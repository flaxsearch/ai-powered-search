I am in the northeastern U.S. and can tell you that most people already own the equipment to hike many of the most difficult all-day mountain trails in my region. You're not even planning to stay overnight. Stage 1: Short, Flat Walks How far do you walk already? For starters, don't do anything too different. Go to the local city or state park and walk the fraction-of-a-mile boardwalk or paved trail. You could probably do this today. Bring a bottle of water or another kind of drink if it's hot. The type of container you store the water in isn't important, as long as it's light enough for you to carry. Wear sunscreen or a hat if it's sunny. Otherwise, wear whatever clothes you find comfortable, and whatever shoes you'd choose if you didn't care how you looked and wanted to walk from one end of your indoor shopping mall to the other. On an even paved trail for a fraction of a mile, you'd be OK even if your favorite walking shoes are flip-flops or high heels. If you want to learn more about what you're seeing, read a book about the local nature. I find it enhances the experience. :) Stage 2: A Bit More Rugged Congratulations. If you're having fun on the easiest hikes and want something more challenging, you're ready to do what I would consider serious hiking. A 1-2 mile trail through the heart of a state or national park, possibly on rough and rocky terrain, can really make you feel far away from civilization. Make sure you bring plenty of water and wear sturdy shoes. Sneakers or any kind of sturdy flats are a good choice, and hiking boots are also okay. You might want to wade through streams or into lakes, and choosing stable trekking sandals as your footwear can make that fun. But don't drink the water without purifying it first. Do NOT wear: Shoes that stretch or wobble. Examples: Flip-flops, leather sandals, Crocs, most dress shoes. On rough trails, these increase the risk of ankle injury. You also want to think twice where you put your feet when the trail is rough, and resist the urge to rush downhill. Uphill or downhill, keep a steady pace on rocky trails. To be on the safe side, you'd want to hike with a partner starting at this level. Any type of physical activity incurs a small risk of injury, and you don't want to be alone in a remote area if you're in trouble. You would also want to be familiar with the trail markers, and make sure you can clearly see the markers or the trail at all times. (On some trails this is a challenge...) Stage 3: Moderate Day Hiking 3-6 mile trails can lead you through several different habitats, around lakes, or up small mountains. At this level, you can start to really know the hikes in a major state or national park. Make sure you're in reasonably good physical shape before you attempt a hike of this difficulty. You should be very comfortable doing the easy trails. These harder hikes will take several hours, so you should wear shoes that won't give you blisters. Bring meals or snack food (such as gorp) as appropriate. You may also want to bring a flashlight, in case you miscalculate the time and find yourself stuck on the trail after dark. If you think the weather might change, bring or wear layers of clothes. Stage 4: Are You Going to Follow the Call of the Wild? If you're comfortable with the easy and moderate hikes, you're ready to leave your old life behind and spend a full day immersed in a trail. You probably want to wear some of the sturdiest shoes you own - sneakers or hiking boots, so long as they don't give you blisters. I recommend you take yourself to New Hampshire, which the poet Robert Frost called \\\"one of the two best states in the Union. Vermont's the other.\\\" http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/robert_frost/poems/733 He wrote this for a reason. You can take one of his (and my) favorite trails. It's unforgettable. http://www.hikenewengland.com/FranconiaRidge081011.html If you hike the whole loop, you will ascend above the Northwoods and reach tundra and spectacular views. New Hampshire isn't quite as rugged as Jack London's The Call of the Wild , which is set even farther north. Still, its motto is \\\"Live Free or Die\\\" and despite its small size, it would mess with Texas. Perhaps you will be asking the question \\\"Hiking: How to stop?\\\" Don't.\",\n",

The Groton Town Forest race is part of a larger trail races circuit. You can probably find a list of the other races by digging around a little.

For example, I've put in some trails for specific areas in California that are near my house or that I've visited. The problem with both of these is that they don't provide topo maps with contour lines. Google maps does provide maps with hill shading, although IIRC they make it a hassle to print them, and you can't get features such as a UTM grid. There are some third parties that provide free topo maps in formats friendly to handheld devices, but I'm not aware of any that give global coverage. Here are some I know of, with links to a sample area in California so you can compare them. Stamen : shading but not contours Closed Contour : only covers the Sierra Toposm : US only If you just want color images of normal paper maps, then usually they can be obtained easily from national governments' web sites. Examples: US Topo Maps : There are more convenient and better designed third-party portals such as http://libremap.org . Topo maps with trails are available for some USFS lands from the Forest Service . UK Ordnance Survey Switzerland Maps : an extremely well designed site Mexico Topo Maps : theoretically allows you to download maps, but appears to be unusable In my experience, the most practical approach is to get maps on paper, either by buying them or by downloading images and printing them out on a color printer. This has the advantage that it's cheap or free, and there is coverage of pretty much everywhere that I want to go. You can get maps with UTM grids on them, or draw in UTM grids. The UTM grid makes it possible to use them with GPS. An added advantage of the paper maps is that if your GPS unit isn't working (dead batteries, no satellites visible in the sky because you're in a deep canyon, ...), you can still use them. Yet another advantage is that they provide much higher resolution than an LCD screen at any given scale.\",\n",

Here in north-central Massachusetts, like in much of the US northeast away from the major hiking destinations, there is a surprisingly large scattering of land open to the public with trails on it. There is no one place to go for info about all of them. Most of these areas are just patches of land with maybe a sign and hopefully a few blazes on the trails. There is no visitor center or any building or any staff, so there is nobody you can call directly and there isn't likely a web site with up to date conditions. For the obscure local trails, you have to use a little common sense. For example, if you wanted to explore the Harry J Rich State Forest in Groton, which is unstaffed with no facilities, you use a little logic and realize it's conditions aren't going to be that different from a few miles away. For example, you might inquire about the Willard Brook State Park in Townsend. Conditions will be similar enough, and someone there may have even recently been out to the Rich Forest. Or find out about conditions in the town. Lots of towns have conservation groups with web sites. These don't generally list current conditions since that would be too much work for the volunteers to keep up with. But, there is usually some contact info. To use Groton as the example again, there is the Groton Conservation Commission, the Groton Trails committee, the private Groton Conservation Trust, each with web pages. It doesn't take much digging to find a email address or find that there is a grotontrails email list. Send a message saying you're from out of town and would like to know the conditions, and you'll probably have half a dozen replies by the end of the day. If you want to hike in Littleton or Ayer or Westford instead, dig around there for web sites and contact information. For example, Littleton has the Littleton Conservation Trust private group, and the headquarters for the New England Forestry Foundation are located there. If you can't find anything for Ayer, for example, look at a map and realize that whatever you find out about Littleton or Groton will be pretty close. These are just local examples that I am familiar with since I live and work here, but this sort of small local patchwork of organizations applies to most of New England, and probably to many other places too. So the answer for less known places is to dig around for local info and be willing to extrapolate to the place you are actually interested in.\",\n",

       "  {'body': 'Hiking isn\\'t too different from walking, except that the terrain may be rougher (depending on the path) and navigation might be more difficult (again, depending on the path). I am in the northeastern U.S. and can tell you that most people already own the equipment to hike many of the most difficult all-day mountain trails in my region. You\\'re not even planning to stay overnight. Stage 1: Short, Flat Walks How far do you walk already? For starters, don\\'t do anything too different. Go to the local city or state park and walk the fraction-of-a-mile boardwalk or paved trail. You could probably do this today. Bring a bottle of water or another kind of drink if it\\'s hot. The type of container you store the water in isn\\'t important, as long as it\\'s light enough for you to carry. Wear sunscreen or a hat if it\\'s sunny. Otherwise, wear whatever clothes you find comfortable, and whatever shoes you\\'d choose if you didn\\'t care how you looked and wanted to walk from one end of your indoor shopping mall to the other. On an even paved trail for a fraction of a mile, you\\'d be OK even if your favorite walking shoes are flip-flops or high heels. If you want to learn more about what you\\'re seeing, read a book about the local nature. I find it enhances the experience. :) Stage 2: A Bit More Rugged Congratulations. If you\\'re having fun on the easiest hikes and want something more challenging, you\\'re ready to do what I would consider serious hiking. A 1-2 mile trail through the heart of a state or national park, possibly on rough and rocky terrain, can really make you feel far away from civilization. Make sure you bring plenty of water and wear sturdy shoes. Sneakers or any kind of sturdy flats are a good choice, and hiking boots are also okay. You might want to wade through streams or into lakes, and choosing stable trekking sandals as your footwear can make that fun. But don\\'t drink the water without purifying it first. Do NOT wear: Shoes that stretch or wobble. Examples: Flip-flops, leather sandals, Crocs, most dress shoes. On rough trails, these increase the risk of ankle injury. You also want to think twice where you put your feet when the trail is rough, and resist the urge to rush downhill. Uphill or downhill, keep a steady pace on rocky trails. To be on the safe side, you\\'d want to hike with a partner starting at this level. Any type of physical activity incurs a small risk of injury, and you don\\'t want to be alone in a remote area if you\\'re in trouble. You would also want to be familiar with the trail markers, and make sure you can clearly see the markers or the trail at all times. (On some trails this is a challenge...) Stage 3: Moderate Day Hiking 3-6 mile trails can lead you through several different habitats, around lakes, or up small mountains. At this level, you can start to really know the hikes in a major state or national park. Make sure you\\'re in reasonably good physical shape before you attempt a hike of this difficulty. You should be very comfortable doing the easy trails. These harder hikes will take several hours, so you should wear shoes that won\\'t give you blisters. Bring meals or snack food (such as gorp) as appropriate. You may also want to bring a flashlight, in case you miscalculate the time and find yourself stuck on the trail after dark. If you think the weather might change, bring or wear layers of clothes. Stage 4: Are You Going to Follow the Call of the Wild? If you\\'re comfortable with the easy and moderate hikes, you\\'re ready to leave your old life behind and spend a full day immersed in a trail. You probably want to wear some of the sturdiest shoes you own - sneakers or hiking boots, so long as they don\\'t give you blisters. I recommend you take yourself to New Hampshire, which the poet Robert Frost called \"one of the two best states in the Union. Vermont\\'s the other.\" http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/robert_frost/poems/733 He wrote this for a reason. You can take one of his (and my) favorite trails. It\\'s unforgettable. http://www.hikenewengland.com/FranconiaRidge081011.html If you hike the whole loop, you will ascend above the Northwoods and reach tundra and spectacular views. New Hampshire isn\\'t quite as rugged as Jack London\\'s The Call of the Wild , which is set even farther north. Still, its motto is \"Live Free or Die\" and despite its small size, it would mess with Texas. Perhaps you will be asking the question \"Hiking: How to stop?\" Don\\'t.',\n",

      "        \"body\": \"Hiking isn't too different from walking, except that the terrain may be rougher (depending on the path) and navigation might be more difficult (again, depending on the path). I am in the northeastern U.S. and can tell you that most people already own the equipment to hike many of the most difficult all-day mountain trails in my region. You're not even planning to stay overnight. Stage 1: Short, Flat Walks How far do you walk already? For starters, don't do anything too different. Go to the local city or state park and walk the fraction-of-a-mile boardwalk or paved trail. You could probably do this today. Bring a bottle of water or another kind of drink if it's hot. The type of container you store the water in isn't important, as long as it's light enough for you to carry. Wear sunscreen or a hat if it's sunny. Otherwise, wear whatever clothes you find comfortable, and whatever shoes you'd choose if you didn't care how you looked and wanted to walk from one end of your indoor shopping mall to the other. On an even paved trail for a fraction of a mile, you'd be OK even if your favorite walking shoes are flip-flops or high heels. If you want to learn more about what you're seeing, read a book about the local nature. I find it enhances the experience. :) Stage 2: A Bit More Rugged Congratulations. If you're having fun on the easiest hikes and want something more challenging, you're ready to do what I would consider serious hiking. A 1-2 mile trail through the heart of a state or national park, possibly on rough and rocky terrain, can really make you feel far away from civilization. Make sure you bring plenty of water and wear sturdy shoes. Sneakers or any kind of sturdy flats are a good choice, and hiking boots are also okay. You might want to wade through streams or into lakes, and choosing stable trekking sandals as your footwear can make that fun. But don't drink the water without purifying it first. Do NOT wear: Shoes that stretch or wobble. Examples: Flip-flops, leather sandals, Crocs, most dress shoes. On rough trails, these increase the risk of ankle injury. You also want to think twice where you put your feet when the trail is rough, and resist the urge to rush downhill. Uphill or downhill, keep a steady pace on rocky trails. To be on the safe side, you'd want to hike with a partner starting at this level. Any type of physical activity incurs a small risk of injury, and you don't want to be alone in a remote area if you're in trouble. You would also want to be familiar with the trail markers, and make sure you can clearly see the markers or the trail at all times. (On some trails this is a challenge...) Stage 3: Moderate Day Hiking 3-6 mile trails can lead you through several different habitats, around lakes, or up small mountains. At this level, you can start to really know the hikes in a major state or national park. Make sure you're in reasonably good physical shape before you attempt a hike of this difficulty. You should be very comfortable doing the easy trails. These harder hikes will take several hours, so you should wear shoes that won't give you blisters. Bring meals or snack food (such as gorp) as appropriate. You may also want to bring a flashlight, in case you miscalculate the time and find yourself stuck on the trail after dark. If you think the weather might change, bring or wear layers of clothes. Stage 4: Are You Going to Follow the Call of the Wild? If you're comfortable with the easy and moderate hikes, you're ready to leave your old life behind and spend a full day immersed in a trail. You probably want to wear some of the sturdiest shoes you own - sneakers or hiking boots, so long as they don't give you blisters. I recommend you take yourself to New Hampshire, which the poet Robert Frost called \\\"one of the two best states in the Union. Vermont's the other.\\\" http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/robert_frost/poems/733 He wrote this for a reason. You can take one of his (and my) favorite trails. It's unforgettable. http://www.hikenewengland.com/FranconiaRidge081011.html If you hike the whole loop, you will ascend above the Northwoods and reach tundra and spectacular views. New Hampshire isn't quite as rugged as Jack London's The Call of the Wild , which is set even farther north. Still, its motto is \\\"Live Free or Die\\\" and despite its small size, it would mess with Texas. Perhaps you will be asking the question \\\"Hiking: How to stop?\\\" Don't.\",\n",

For example, I've put in some trails for specific areas in California that are near my house or that I've visited. The problem with both of these is that they don't provide topo maps with contour lines. Google maps does provide maps with hill shading, although IIRC they make it a hassle to print them, and you can't get features such as a UTM grid. There are some third parties that provide free topo maps in formats friendly to handheld devices, but I'm not aware of any that give global coverage. Here are some I know of, with links to a sample area in California so you can compare them. Stamen : shading but not contours Closed Contour : only covers the Sierra Toposm : US only If you just want color images of normal paper maps, then usually they can be obtained easily from national governments' web sites. Examples: US Topo Maps : There are more convenient and better designed third-party portals such as http://libremap.org . Topo maps with trails are available for some USFS lands from the Forest Service . UK Ordnance Survey Switzerland Maps : an extremely well designed site Mexico Topo Maps : theoretically allows you to download maps, but appears to be unusable In my experience, the most practical approach is to get maps on paper, either by buying them or by downloading images and printing them out on a color printer. This has the advantage that it's cheap or free, and there is coverage of pretty much everywhere that I want to go. You can get maps with UTM grids on them, or draw in UTM grids. The UTM grid makes it possible to use them with GPS. An added advantage of the paper maps is that if your GPS unit isn't working (dead batteries, no satellites visible in the sky because you're in a deep canyon, ...), you can still use them. Yet another advantage is that they provide much higher resolution than an LCD screen at any given scale.\",\n",

I'm pretty sure there is a web site about trail conditions, but for the White Mountains of New Hampshire you can get trail conditions info directly at the Pinkham Notch visitor center run by the AMC, the National Forest visitor center in Lincoln, and probably various places you can call including the several you could walk into to ask. Every major park or forest has some place you can call or look on the web. For more obscure places (hiking-wise), it gets less formal. Here in north-central Massachusetts, like in much of the US northeast away from the major hiking destinations, there is a surprisingly large scattering of land open to the public with trails on it. There is no one place to go for info about all of them. Most of these areas are just patches of land with maybe a sign and hopefully a few blazes on the trails. There is no visitor center or any building or any staff, so there is nobody you can call directly and there isn't likely a web site with up to date conditions. For the obscure local trails, you have to use a little common sense. For example, if you wanted to explore the Harry J Rich State Forest in Groton, which is unstaffed with no facilities, you use a little logic and realize it's conditions aren't going to be that different from a few miles away. For example, you might inquire about the Willard Brook State Park in Townsend. Conditions will be similar enough, and someone there may have even recently been out to the Rich Forest. Or find out about conditions in the town. Lots of towns have conservation groups with web sites. These don't generally list current conditions since that would be too much work for the volunteers to keep up with. But, there is usually some contact info. To use Groton as the example again, there is the Groton Conservation Commission, the Groton Trails committee, the private Groton Conservation Trust, each with web pages. It doesn't take much digging to find a email address or find that there is a grotontrails email list. Send a message saying you're from out of town and would like to know the conditions, and you'll probably have half a dozen replies by the end of the day. If you want to hike in Littleton or Ayer or Westford instead, dig around there for web sites and contact information. For example, Littleton has the Littleton Conservation Trust private group, and the headquarters for the New England Forestry Foundation are located there. If you can't find anything for Ayer, for example, look at a map and realize that whatever you find out about Littleton or Groton will be pretty close. These are just local examples that I am familiar with since I live and work here, but this sort of small local patchwork of organizations applies to most of New England, and probably to many other places too. So the answer for less known places is to dig around for local info and be willing to extrapolate to the place you are actually interested in.\",\n",

I am in the northeastern U.S. and can tell you that most people already own the equipment to hike many of the most difficult all-day mountain trails in my region. You\\'re not even planning to stay overnight. Stage 1: Short, Flat Walks How far do you walk already? For starters, don\\'t do anything too different. Go to the local city or state park and walk the fraction-of-a-mile boardwalk or paved trail. You could probably do this today. Bring a bottle of water or another kind of drink if it\\'s hot. The type of container you store the water in isn\\'t important, as long as it\\'s light enough for you to carry. Wear sunscreen or a hat if it\\'s sunny. Otherwise, wear whatever clothes you find comfortable, and whatever shoes you\\'d choose if you didn\\'t care how you looked and wanted to walk from one end of your indoor shopping mall to the other. On an even paved trail for a fraction of a mile, you\\'d be OK even if your favorite walking shoes are flip-flops or high heels. If you want to learn more about what you\\'re seeing, read a book about the local nature. I find it enhances the experience. :) Stage 2: A Bit More Rugged Congratulations. If you\\'re having fun on the easiest hikes and want something more challenging, you\\'re ready to do what I would consider serious hiking. A 1-2 mile trail through the heart of a state or national park, possibly on rough and rocky terrain, can really make you feel far away from civilization. Make sure you bring plenty of water and wear sturdy shoes. Sneakers or any kind of sturdy flats are a good choice, and hiking boots are also okay. You might want to wade through streams or into lakes, and choosing stable trekking sandals as your footwear can make that fun. But don\\'t drink the water without purifying it first. Do NOT wear: Shoes that stretch or wobble. Examples: Flip-flops, leather sandals, Crocs, most dress shoes. On rough trails, these increase the risk of ankle injury. You also want to think twice where you put your feet when the trail is rough, and resist the urge to rush downhill. Uphill or downhill, keep a steady pace on rocky trails. To be on the safe side, you\\'d want to hike with a partner starting at this level. Any type of physical activity incurs a small risk of injury, and you don\\'t want to be alone in a remote area if you\\'re in trouble. You would also want to be familiar with the trail markers, and make sure you can clearly see the markers or the trail at all times. (On some trails this is a challenge...) Stage 3: Moderate Day Hiking 3-6 mile trails can lead you through several different habitats, around lakes, or up small mountains. At this level, you can start to really know the hikes in a major state or national park. Make sure you\\'re in reasonably good physical shape before you attempt a hike of this difficulty. You should be very comfortable doing the easy trails. These harder hikes will take several hours, so you should wear shoes that won\\'t give you blisters. Bring meals or snack food (such as gorp) as appropriate. You may also want to bring a flashlight, in case you miscalculate the time and find yourself stuck on the trail after dark. If you think the weather might change, bring or wear layers of clothes. Stage 4: Are You Going to Follow the Call of the Wild? If you\\'re comfortable with the easy and moderate hikes, you\\'re ready to leave your old life behind and spend a full day immersed in a trail. You probably want to wear some of the sturdiest shoes you own - sneakers or hiking boots, so long as they don\\'t give you blisters. I recommend you take yourself to New Hampshire, which the poet Robert Frost called \"one of the two best states in the Union. Vermont\\'s the other.\" http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/robert_frost/poems/733 He wrote this for a reason. You can take one of his (and my) favorite trails. It\\'s unforgettable. http://www.hikenewengland.com/FranconiaRidge081011.html If you hike the whole loop, you will ascend above the Northwoods and reach tundra and spectacular views. New Hampshire isn\\'t quite as rugged as Jack London\\'s The Call of the Wild , which is set even farther north.

       "  {'body': \"Most trails for hiking are also good for running. In fact, I'd make the assumption that a hiking trail is a running trail without specific knowledge that makes it inappropriate. One way to get a list of trails others deem acceptable for running is to use those that trail races are run on. There are quite a few of those. For example in my area, trail races are held every fall in the Groton Town Forest. The specific routes used are carefully cleaned up over the previous week, but really, these are just ordinary hiking trails that work out to the right distances. The Groton Town Forest race is part of a larger trail races circuit. You can probably find a list of the other races by digging around a little. All those will show you courses that are obviously fine for running. However, I know several avid trail runners in town, and they use a number of our local trails that aren't special with respect to running versus hiking. Local trails will largely be documented on local web sites. Again, you haven't specified your location so I can't tell how relevant it is to you, but if you're near Groton MA, check out http://www.grotontrails.org . We have a network of over 110 miles of trails (more miles of trails than paved roads), and I can't think of good reasons why they aren't just as runnable as they are hikable. And, we're just one town in north-central MA. For longer routes, check out some of the regional trails, like the Midstate or M&M, in central MA, but there are others in other regions.\",\n",

Open Street Maps is a free and open source site that works sort of like Wikipedia, and it often has good coverage of hiking trails, but the coverage may be somewhat hit-or-miss. For example, I've put in some trails for specific areas in California that are near my house or that I've visited. The problem with both of these is that they don't provide topo maps with contour lines. Google maps does provide maps with hill shading, although IIRC they make it a hassle to print them, and you can't get features such as a UTM grid. There are some third parties that provide free topo maps in formats friendly to handheld devices, but I'm not aware of any that give global coverage. Here are some I know of, with links to a sample area in California so you can compare them. Stamen : shading but not contours Closed Contour : only covers the Sierra Toposm : US only If you just want color images of normal paper maps, then usually they can be obtained easily from national governments' web sites. Examples: US Topo Maps : There are more convenient and better designed third-party portals such as http://libremap.org . Topo maps with trails are available for some USFS lands from the Forest Service . UK Ordnance Survey Switzerland Maps : an extremely well designed site Mexico Topo Maps : theoretically allows you to download maps, but appears to be unusable In my experience, the most practical approach is to get maps on paper, either by buying them or by downloading images and printing them out on a color printer. This has the advantage that it's cheap or free, and there is coverage of pretty much everywhere that I want to go. You can get maps with UTM grids on them, or draw in UTM grids. The UTM grid makes it possible to use them with GPS. An added advantage of the paper maps is that if your GPS unit isn't working (dead batteries, no satellites visible in the sky because you're in a deep canyon, ...), you can still use them. Yet another advantage is that they provide much higher resolution than an LCD screen at any given scale.\",\n",

       "  {'body': \"Getting trail conditions is region-specific. For example, in New England the Appalachian Mountain Club provides a good deal of trail info. I'm pretty sure there is a web site about trail conditions, but for the White Mountains of New Hampshire you can get trail conditions info directly at the Pinkham Notch visitor center run by the AMC, the National Forest visitor center in Lincoln, and probably various places you can call including the several you could walk into to ask. Every major park or forest has some place you can call or look on the web. For more obscure places (hiking-wise), it gets less formal. Here in north-central Massachusetts, like in much of the US northeast away from the major hiking destinations, there is a surprisingly large scattering of land open to the public with trails on it. There is no one place to go for info about all of them. Most of these areas are just patches of land with maybe a sign and hopefully a few blazes on the trails. There is no visitor center or any building or any staff, so there is nobody you can call directly and there isn't likely a web site with up to date conditions. For the obscure local trails, you have to use a little common sense. For example, if you wanted to explore the Harry J Rich State Forest in Groton, which is unstaffed with no facilities, you use a little logic and realize it's conditions aren't going to be that different from a few miles away. For example, you might inquire about the Willard Brook State Park in Townsend. Conditions will be similar enough, and someone there may have even recently been out to the Rich Forest. Or find out about conditions in the town. Lots of towns have conservation groups with web sites. These don't generally list current conditions since that would be too much work for the volunteers to keep up with. But, there is usually some contact info. To use Groton as the example again, there is the Groton Conservation Commission, the Groton Trails committee, the private Groton Conservation Trust, each with web pages. It doesn't take much digging to find a email address or find that there is a grotontrails email list. Send a message saying you're from out of town and would like to know the conditions, and you'll probably have half a dozen replies by the end of the day. If you want to hike in Littleton or Ayer or Westford instead, dig around there for web sites and contact information. For example, Littleton has the Littleton Conservation Trust private group, and the headquarters for the New England Forestry Foundation are located there. If you can't find anything for Ayer, for example, look at a map and realize that whatever you find out about Littleton or Groton will be pretty close. These are just local examples that I am familiar with since I live and work here, but this sort of small local patchwork of organizations applies to most of New England, and probably to many other places too. So the answer for less known places is to dig around for local info and be willing to extrapolate to the place you are actually interested in.\",\n",

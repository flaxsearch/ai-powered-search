I would never buy one, though, for the following reasons: Every tent of those I have seen have been very prone to breaking. A friend of mine just discovered his (brand new one) was broken when he arrived on the campground. Because the poles are fixed inside you can´t even improvise and repair them with duct tape. They are often more expensive than comparable cheap tents. Setting up a modern, regular tent, even a very cheap one, is done in five minutes. Not that much of discomfort, especially compared with repairing broken poles on a throw tent. They often have a strange form when packed (big, wheel-shaped), which can´t be fit in any backpack. Probably not a problem if you get there by car, but for public transport or hitch-hiking or if you have to walk to get to the campground I wouldn´t like it. I would strongly advise against buying any pop-up tents. Many festivals, although short and not comparable with \"real\" outdoor use, are a rough ground where many things can break due to alcohol and other drugs. And these tents are ridiculously unstable. The tent I have used for many festivals without any problems is a standard two-person iglu tent like the one shown below, available for around 25€, well below your price margin. It is easy to set up (5 minutes), more robust and cheaper than pop-up tents and gets the job done. You will have to look for a reseller on your own, though, but probably just searching for iglu tent will do the job. For ecological reasons, you might consider buying a used tent, so you don´t throw away something brand new.',\n",

       "    'body': 'I have a nice and small tent I really like that is around 30 years old. It is from Sierra West, but I don\\'t remember the model name. Here is a picture so that you can see the size and general construction: This tent is held up with two bows of fiberglass rods that fit into each other. A small bow of 4 rods makes the arch at the foot end, and 6 rods are used at the head end. Unfortunately, one of the rods has just broken: The rod is 14 inches long, the fiberglass part is 6.5 mm in diameter, and the outer diameter of the aluminum piece is 9.5 mm. The fiberglass is cracked near the aluminum sleave, and it is rough with fibers sticking out at the right end where it fits into the aluminum sleave of the next piece. The problem is, the company that made this tent seems to have vanished and I don\\'t know how to get replacement rods. I\\'d like to get a complete set of rods, since if this one went the others are probably not far behind. There seem to be aluminum rods available with bungy cord in the middle, but finding a set that is exactly the length this tent requires seems to be impossible. Anyone know how to get parts for this old tent, or have any other ideas? Added: Yes, it\\'s easy to find generic replacement tent poles, but the ones I have seen are all quite different from what my tent uses. This is a particularly small tent and the radius of curvature is significantly smaller than other tents. This means the thicker poles that are easy to find would be stressed much more. Mine are only 6.5 mm diameter, probably for a good reason. The replacement poles are also much longer than mine. I suppose the long poles could be cut down, but cutting fiberglass is tricky and can easily damage the material if the right tools aren\\'t used, which I probably don\\'t have since I don\\'t know exactly what the right tool would be. I am imagining just cutting with a saw would fray the fibers, which is basically cracking the fiberglass, which can\\'t be a good thing. Another issue is that the pole ends need to fit into the grommets on my tent. I rather doubt there is such a thing as a standard grommet diameter. This is not as easy as just Googling for \"tent pole replacement\". Surely someone here has been thru this process before and has some words of wisdom? Added 2: This is in response to a comment asking for more details of the rods. The grommets that the end of the tent poles fit into are just circular metal disks with holes in them. I don\\'t have the tent here, but the inner diameter of these holes is a little larger than the diameter of the tent poles, which is 6.5 mm. The picture shows a middle piece, but the end pieces have black plastic end caps, with the tips of those being about the same diameter as the fiberglass rod (6.5 mm). The fiberglass rods are solid, so have no inner diameter.',\n",

       "    'body': \"I have several suggestions of how you could do this. If you are going to use rope I would use 3 pieces of thinner rope 2/3mm paracord should be more than strong enough. I would then tie a shear lashing (see picture) on each leg. You want to try and use a significant length of the pole or possible even tie to lashings per pole to reduce the amount of twisting you get. However, using rope takes relatively long to setup and is relatively hard to do if you are not experienced, so I would probably use a different method. Another alternative would be to use bungee You would need 2 pieces of thinnish bungee per leg, probably no more than 20-30cm for your thickness of pole. Tie each bungee into a loop using a large knot such as a figure of eight, although a simple overhand knot would probably do. Then wrap the loop several times around the two poles until it is extended and reasonably tight. To tie it off just loop the remaining end of bungee through the knot in the other end. To make this more secure you can wrap knot under all the wrapping of bungee. You can also get hooks you can hook onto rather than looping through the knot which can be a bot unsecure if you're not careful. This is a very fast and easy way to attach the poles but is not the most secure and can slip a bit if left for a long time. Its also better suited to slightly thicker poles you may have difficulty getting the elastic tight enough on these poles. A third suggestion you be to use cable ties or jubilee clips . You would probably need two of these per leg. Cable ties are plastic, much lighter and easy to attach, but generally have to be cut off and so are one use only. Which may be an issue depending on how often you use the tripod. Also you need to dispose of the old clips sensibly, easily in an outdoors environment. Jubilee clips can be a bit of a pain to attach and generally require a screwdriver to tighten or remove. This could be an issue for outdoors use. My final suggestion would be to make a connector to attach the poles to the end of the the legs. From your picture I cannot tell but this would work best if the tent poles are not attached together, but it might work anyway. There are many ways you could make such a thing but my suggestion would be for each leg use a short piece of PVC pipe, just slightly larger internal diameter than the poles so that they can slide inside. Drill a hole right through the middle of the pipe and put a bolt through it. If you want to make it more secure and have the right tools you could but a threaded hole on each side and put a bolt in to act as a tighter. This method requires the most work beforehand but would probably result in very easy assembly in the field.\",\n",

There are easy patches for breaks in the middle of a pole (just slide a sleeve of longer diameter tube over the break area), but unfortunately, aluminum poles aren't easily repaired, especially on the ends, and this is due to the nature of the alloys. It's not that the alloy is cheap, it's that it was put under stress it wasn't meant to take. My 1 year old daughter broke my expensive MSR poles once by hanging off the poles while I was in the process of taking down the tent. The pole she hung on was no longer fully inserted onto the fitting, and the leverage caused it to break the same way you describe. Related: How to straighten a bent tent pole As I explain in the answer linked above, once hardened aluminum is damaged, it can't be un damaged without putting it through an annealing and re-hardening process, otherwise it just breaks. Your best option for a repair is to take your tent back to REI and see it they will replace the section of pole for you. They may have some extra lengths laying around and give one to you, or they can probably hook you up with one for cheap. If you aren't that lucky at the store, then your next best option for repair is to find some length of pole that does fit into your fitting, and cutting back your other pole so you can fit them together in the fashion I describe above using a length off larger tube. This repair will however affect the flexibility of your pole. Your last resort will be to buy a completely new set of poles for your tent. The advantage to this is your tent will be as good as new, and you'll have ample supply or replacement parts if you ever break a pole again.\",\n",

The nice thing about these ones is that you would attach them to your tent (the other ones are usually closer to your stakes) and then if you find your tent sagging or billowing in the wind, you can reach the tensioner from inside the tent to tighten it. In either case, you have to choose cordage that won't slip. Both stores I've linked to here sell a specific cord diameter that is known not to slip in the locks they are selling.

Lifting the fabric onto the central pole with that half-extended was hard work for someone strong. The poles had to be pretty robust too, as the pitching process involved one or two poles taking most of the weight at various times. The whole thing took well over an hour to put up. Some of the downsides of such designs could be solved with more modern constructions, but trying to lift that canvas by pushing on dome tent poles would get nowhere and/or snap the poles. The bulk and weight made storage difficult. The fabric and pole set each weighed more than an entire similar sized nylon flexible-pole tent. At least here in the UK tents are often stored in lofts (attics) and getting a frame tent up a ladder was hard work if it even fitted through the hatch. Even packing a car was harder due to the bulk. And they're too heavy for roof boxes. If you did ever get home with a wet tent, that's a lot of fabric to get dry - and you have to get it dry thoroughly and quickly to avoid mould. For scouts use, the needs are different. You need robust and large, but they're normally stored somewhere easily accessible, and you have a team of people to erect them (the ones I used were put up rather like raising a barn, in that several people pulled one end up, rather than ever having to lift the fabric high.\",\n",

Many tents can be set up with a minimal amount of pegs in good weather, with the option to user more pegs/cordage in windy conditions. Make sure you have enough pegs for the worst case (and maybe a spare or two). Check all the area/seams/ribbons where most force is applied to the tent: e.g. where cords are attacked, near loops to place pegs, where tent poles are fixed, etc. These areas are bound to experience the highest load so are bound to wear out first.

       "    'body': 'Lightweight shelter selection is all about tradeoffs In general terms, for wind-worthiness you\\'re looking for strong poles, small panels, a low profile, plentiful peg-out points and flies that pitch close to the ground. But this is only a starting point. Choosing lightweight shelters is tough, even for the experienced, and it\\'s all about making the right tradeoffs for your particular requirements. Space and liveability Storm-worthiness and durability Light weight You can have any two of three. So how much storm-worthiness do you really need? Because if you want something genuinely bombproof you\\'re going to have to pay in terms of weight or liveability. How much wind-worthiness do you really need? If you camp in sheltered spots below the treeline you probably don\\'t need to worry too much about wind. Most of the higher-end manufacturers will ensure that a 3 season tent can survive up to 30 mph (Force 6: Strong Breeze). So focus on weight and liveability. If you camp above the treeline in exposed spots it\\'s another game entirely - you want something that can survive upwards of 50 mph in case you get caught out, and most shelters simply won\\'t deliver. How to choose a tent for exposed camping? There are two issues here - design and construction quality. For design, there are two broad categories - peg-supported and self-supported. Peg supported designs include the Pyramid, A-Frame, Single Hoop and Tunnel. They can all work well, but rely entirely on finding enough good peg placements. Pitching can be finicky as you have to achieve a good stretch on the panels, and the pegs have to do double duty holding up the tent structure and bracing against the wind. Many designs have a big footprint, and if a peg pops in a storm you have a problem. Walking poles are stronger than any lightweight tent pole, so if you carry them you could save weight with a shelter designed to use walking poles for support. There\\'s quite a choice these days, from mainstream brands such as MSR and Black Diamond to cottage manufacturers like TarpTent, TrekkerTent, MLD, Six Moons and Yama. For difficult pitches on sandy or rocky soil \"freestanding\" designs using flexible poles can be more robust. (They\\'re not really freestanding - they still require a few pegs, but that\\'s how the marketing departments describe them). The poles hold up the tent and stretch most of the panels, leaving the pegs with the single duty of bracing against wind. But poles are heavy so these benefits come at a cost. A true geometric is impractical in a solo lightweight tent, so you are restricted to a two-pole crossover design or to something using connection clips like the Big Agnes range. Personally I\\'m wary of the clip designs in a serious bad-weather tent as they look vulnerable to failure. Makers like Hilleberg who design for serious bad weather don\\'t use them. But with the classic crossover, design restraints mean that you are either looking at something quite heavy like the Hilleberg Suolo at 2.2 kilos, or something tiny like the TrekkerTent Bivy at 1 kilo. The second issue is build-quality. I\\'ve always thought of the single-hoop design as quite limited, but here\\'s a video of a Hilleberg Akto doing fine in a measured 85mph (Hurricane Force 12) wind! Quite a testament to good materials and construction. So if you\\'re looking for serious storm-worthiness, focus on companies like Hilleberg, Trekkertent, Tarptent (their Scarp 1 and StratoSpire 1 in particular are good in wind) and Mountain Laurel who have a reputation for bombproof build quality. Some manufacturers cut corners with flimsy materials and poles to achieve lightness at the cost of durability. So to sum up... As you can see, it\\'s all about making the right tradeoffs for the conditions. For sheltered camping you can prioritise weight and livability. Don\\'t push your luck with the weather and pick your campsites with care. For above the treeline, you have to trade off the costs and benefits of freestanding and peg-supported designs. And you should focus on manufacturers with a proven reputation for building storm-worthy shelters. As for the Big Agnes designs, I personally wouldn\\'t fancy taking them anywhere exposed - too complex and failure-prone for my tastes. And they pitch inner-first, which can be a nightmare in heavy rain...',\n",

The adult-sized, rectangular ones were cheaper than the tapered ones, and they re-folded nice. They also proved to be more durable than I expected. I only used one of the pads on my trip (5? nights). It made a few squeaky noises as I moved in the night, but I found the tradeoff quite nice. $1.99 sleeping pad alternative is cheap/light/compact (though I\\'d still bring 2 in case of puncture). When you buy gear can have a huge impact on cost. In particular, a cheap tent and sleeping bag can halve in price if you buy it on a real sale (not the post-marked up so we can mark it back down Christmas sales). Tent: I bought 4 hiker/biker tents from Sports Authority when they were on sale for 10 bucks. I think the sale price is now 15 bucks. It\\'s a compact and reasonable weight tent (requires stakes to stand, though). It\\'s super-fragile. I\\'ve broken a couple poles and ripped a door before. Low quality, but at a rather great price. Ground Cover: cheap tents often have really thin floors, making ground cover somewhat necessary to help the tent endure. Those mylar emergency blankets can function as ground cover, doubling the lifetime of your cheap tent. Throw the mylar away every trip and use a new one. Backpack: Weight- = Cost+. I bought a 7 pound backpack for under 40 bucks. It was actually quite (unnecessarily?) rugged. Thick fabric, beefy zipper, etc. Very adjustable, fitting friends with about a foot in height difference and 50 pounds in weight difference. Anyway, if you don\\'t want to rent or buy used, adding a few pounds can save you/your friend a ton. Walking poles: My girlfriend (now wife) mocked me for suggesting a pair of walking poles on her first trip. They look ridiculous to anyone who hasn\\'t backpacked. I bought a pair of cheap poles for 20 bucks. First stream crossing in February (hovering around freezing), she almost fell in. She caught herself with a pole and now considers them a necessity. There\\'s not a huge difference in quality between those cheap poles and the ones my folks bought me for 80 bucks. However, for an even cheaper alternative, see \"stick found on ground at trailhead\". As an aside, freezing stream crossings might not be a good first trail.',\n",

       "    'body': 'A first consideration in considering wind-resistance should be your choice of stakes and how you use them; an improperly staked tent is largely equivalent to an oversized kite. (Of course there is no rule saying you must use the stakes that come with a tent.) In terms of tent design, there are some factors that can only be evaluated though detailed photos or direct inspection, although some may be advertised in the specs. For example, smaller-diameter poles will be weaker than larger diameter poles, and stiffer aluminum alloys may tolerate less bending before breakage. Finally, some models allow you to double-up the poles for additional strength. You will also want to look for well-sewn attachment points for stakes and guy-lines as well as the ability to use doubled-up poles in high wind situations. If the tent has additional tie-out points you can use them to stiffen the structure; some will even allow you to use internal guy-lines to strengthen the structure. (These are helpful against downward gusts of wind, which may happen on lee slopes or behind large rocks that block direct wind.) When looking at overall tent design one question to ask is \"how well will this spill wind?\"; smaller fabric panels, kept taut, will generally deflect wind better than larger, more drooping sections of fabric. Thus, the ability to tightly stake out the tent is important to good wind resistance. Note that the design of tents like the BA ones listed in the original question appear rather vulnerable to flattening out in high winds. (Refer to the Outdoor Magazine videos for an example of what this looks like.) Another key consideration will thus be \"just how strong will the winds be?\", as some environments call for sturdier designs. Finally, Outdoor Magazine conducted some wind tests of tents using a very large fan. Understanding German is not too necessary, as the videos mostly speak for themselves and should give you an idea of how different designs are affected by high winds. My primary source for this is the (unfortunately paywalled) article \" Storm Resistance of Ultralight Shelters \" at BackpackingLight, which I must still recommend due to its thoroughness. Also, the comment thread below the article should be freely readable. Additional (free) BPL resources include a few discussion threads: Internal guys in a Nallo 2 What kind of pole is strongest?

The top section of the aluminum tent pole tore at the end (see blue area of picture), and in order to get it to fit in the plastic piece it was supposed to (the inside of the black plastic), it had to be re-bent. This eventually caused the end 1-2cm to rip off completely, leaving me with a shortened and slightly misshapen top tent pole section, which now barely fits into the black plastic piece and over the other tent pole piece inside of that. Is there any way to repair this piece with off the shelf parts?

This invariably gets onto the tarp surface and makes the tent floor wet, or icy. I have never purchased an aftermarket tent floor, because they are overpriced and can be easily made following the steps above.

       "    'body': \"Everyone has given a lot of good advice about clothing and shoes. I'd like to add to what ShemSeger said about the tent. If you are expecting rain, or if it is raining, you want to be extra careful about how you set up your tent. Normally, you would just be looking for a nice, flat place without stones, but if you're expecting rain, that nice flat place can sometimes become a nice puddle or small lake. If you're expecting rain, you may want to choose a tent site with a very slight incline and build a slight berm a few inches uphill from it from leaves and dirt to encourage runoff to go around the tent. You will also want to make sure your footprint/tarp/ground sheet under the tent (if you're using one, which I would recommend) is the right size for your tent. If it is too small, it won't protect all of the tent bottom, if it is too large, fold the excess under and tuck it below the footprint. This (and the incline) helps to avoid pooling extra water between the tent and the footprint. I'm afraid I respectfully disagree with Mike Ounsworth -- I don't think keeping a tarp inside the tent will help you stay dry. Feel free to skip using a footprint/ground-cloth, but I would recommend against bringing it inside the tent. You really want to concentrate on keeping the water outside the tent -- if the water is inside the tent, you're already going to be unhappy, as your seam-sealed waterproof tent bottom will become a small pond, and a tarp inside that mini-kiddie-pool is not going to stop the water getting you and your gear wet. Bringing a used tarp inside at your next campsite on a multi-day backpacking trip is also likely to bring moisture and dirt. You'll also want to take extra care in staking the tent and fly. If the fly is too slack, it is more likely to catch and hold extra water instead of letting it run off. If water pools in the fly, it is going to seep through and drip inside the tent. It is also a lot easier for stakes to get pulled out due to wind when the ground is wet, so you may want to make sure you have high quality tent stakes that will hold well. And if you're hiking close to a river or stream, a heavy rain can sometimes cause a surprisingly significant rise in the water level, so you may want to bypass enticing camp spots close to water level in favor of higher ground. (Of course, you should never camp right next to the river -- most areas require a minimum distance from water sources, NPS generally wants 100 ft. But the level of the water also matters for keeping dry.) Finally, if your tent has less than a 3/4 fly, you may want to consider setting up an extra tarp above the tent. One more thing I don't see people talking about is your bedding. Down is great for backpacking (light and very packable) but it is terrible when it gets wet -- it loses its insulating properties and takes a long time to dry out. If you use down, make extra sure it stays dry. A silk or synthetic bag-liner can help protect it further from your own dampness, but make sure you have it in a waterproof stuff-sack and not just the regular bag it came in.\",\n",

While the leading makes have probably dealt with this to some extent, not all makes will have. And this can mean more failures than you carry spare hinges, in one go. A permanent repair can be easy or hard depending on the hinge/clip design,and a field splint is likely be harder for a failure at a joint than in the middle of a section. For the smaller ones, not being able to split the weight between two people in a disadvantage. Even for tents that would only be used for car camping, having all the weight and bulk in one lump can be awkward especially in a small car. They also tend to be bulkier to pack than an equivalent conventional tent. When pitching in even a light wind, putting in 2--3 pegs on the upwind side before the tent has any height can be a huge help, especially if you're on your own. If the poles automatically lock together when you spread the fabric, this will be harder. Against that you can offset the extra weight of the poles, so you should be able to find your own workaround. The clips used to be annoying to find and undo when taking the tent down, so the total up+down time wasn't necessarily much shorter unless you were tall enough to reach the high clips first. Again this may have improved. Having said all that, it might sound like I'm against self-erecting tents.

       "    'body': \"To answer your other questions: No, don't insulate the pole at the bottom with a sandal, and yes, you are overthinking this. In the relatively unlikely (but possible) event that lightning does stike your tent pole, you want the current to be conducted to ground as easily as possible. If not, it might find other routes, like thru you. At best a sandal is only going to create arcing around the sandal to the ground. I don't see any advantage to that. At worst it will cause the current to jump from the insulated pole thru you on its way to the ground. If you are in a lightning storm and lightning is likely to strike near you, there is nothing you can do to stop it. What you can do is to give it alternate paths to ground that don't include going thru you. A metal pole nearby will help, but only if it's not so near that it can conduct into your body or arc to your body in preference to conducting straight into the ground. A tall point that is well connected to ground provides roughly a 45° cone of safety. Put another way, you want to be closer to it than its height, assuming you're not adding significant height yourself. For example, being 20-50 feet from a 100 foot tree is about right. Further than 100 feet or so, the tree isn't giving you much protection. A 4 foot metal pole planted 30 feet away, for example, is useless as lightning protection. The other thing to worry about regarding lightning are ground currents caused by a nearby lightning strike. The current doesn't just stop when it hits the ground, it fans out. Unfortunately, the ground isn't uniformly conductive, so it doesn't fan out evenly. There could still be subtantial currents running thru the ground 20 feet from a tree that got hit, for example. The ground isn't a perfect conductor, in fact it's rather a poor conductor most of the time. The large currents times the resistance between two points causes a voltage, which in turn can be large enough to zap you. To minimize ground current danger, try to insulate yourself from the ground and minimize your footprint. The insulation make going thru you a higher resistance path than the ground, and the smaller footprint causes a smaller voltage accross the footprint for the same ground current.\",\n",

But like most things involving gear choice, the real answer is that \"it depends\". Given that you are camping in exposed places, I wouldn\\'t waste much time on the more exotic geodesic architectures - at the consumer end they are mostly designed for below the treeline, and at the mountaineering end they are designed for snow loading and are heavier than you really need for 3-season use. So your main choices boil down to the tunnel, the dome and the pyramid/tepee. You can\\'t go far wrong with a good Scandinavian dome or tunnel You\\'re not going to find any dramatic differences in the space to weight ratio between domes and tunnels - it really boils down to your subjective preferences in terms of features. They both use space effectively, and they both pitch easily and take the weather. The downside is that a robust design is likely to work out at around a kilo per person. But if you want to save weight, your best option is to consider a pyramid Your best option for significant weight savings would be pyramid or tepee. This is especially true if you or your party use walking poles, as in contrast to domes and tunnels you won\\'t need to carry additional tent-poles. Even when made of ultralight materials, mids can be bomber when well executed. For Scandinavian conditions I would have no qualms about using a mid from vendors such as Mountain Laurel or SeekOutside. MLD DuoMid in stormy conditions... The downside of mids is their use of space - the walls slope and you have a pole in the middle. But the upside is that this architecture is more efficient in terms of poles and fabric. So in return for some mild inconveniences you can save significant weight. A spacious double-wall setup from Mountain Laurel starts at under 300g per person if your budget stretches to Cuben - a very significant saving over your typical Scandinavian tunnel or dome. More budget-friendly silnylon models will still work out significantly lighter. Some people don\\'t get on with mids, while others swear by them and wouldn\\'t use anything else. It\\'s really a question of your own usage, preferences and dislikes. But if weight is a priority, I would suggest that mids are certainly an option worth exploring.',\n",

Consider another clean plate over them to keep them clean no shoes in the tent ever. Take them off while your body is in the tent but your feet are still out, and keep them in the vestibule. Put them on in reverse put a lifejacket or other non-fuzzy item down in the vestibule to put non-shoe things on, out of the sand bring a small hand whisk to keep the tent swept out and use it at every takedown, plus daily if you stay in one spot if your knees or backside are sandy, get them brushed off before you get in the tent.

The more likely problem you'll face is maximum stay restrictions. Be sure that you check the requirements before making your decision, because having to move your camp every couple of weeks will dramatically change the setup you want. I recommend calling the USFS, BLM, and applicable State agencies where you plan to go in order to find out what options are available. In some locations you can camp anywhere you want, whereas others are restricted to improved campsites. As for the tent, one of the most important considerations for long term tent living is the entryway. Think of it as a screen porch and mudroom combined. It needs to be spacious enough for you and all of your outside gear, and weather resistant enough to be where that gear is kept. Having a separate entry keeps all of the dirt, dust, brush, grass, mud, water, and/or whatever else you don't want in your tent out. Other requirements to consider are: Wind resistance (extra stakes and tie-downs and durable seems) Water/Sun resistance (dense fabric with UV/Waterproof coatings to prevent rot and deteriorating) Ventilation Fire resistance A common setup is to have one tent with a vestibule as the sleeping, changing, relaxing tent, and another tent that serves as the cooking, eating, working tent. The latter often has large screen panels that can be exposed, with the dining surface also serving as the kitchen prep area and desk. The main categories I would research are: Yurts (not really a tent, which is why they're so great) Outfitter/Guide tents (designed for long term use) Expedition tents (much lighter weight, usable for short term camping) Fabric selection is a trade off between weight, weatherproofness, durability, and livability. Treated canvas is often considered a good selection when the stay is longer than two weeks. It has excellent livability, good durability, moderate weatherproofness, and poor weight (it's very heavy). Nylon is excellent for everything but livability, so long as it's kept away from hot or sharp objects. Polyester is decent but not great, with the lower cost being the main draw. Cabela's is a good place to shop for larger tents. The Alaknak Tent would be a good starting point, and if I were making the decision myself it would be between that and a canvas wall tent.\",\n",

A tent fly would be ideal as it would be very light but I wouldn't use in some places where there are animals dangerous wandering around during the night. A 2-season tent you can zip it up and sleep without the problem of snakes, scorpions or spiders coming to snuggle with you during the night. Where I live, there are no animals to concern me, so I usually carry a fly from end spring to beginning fall and a tent the rest of the year. I only carry a full tent because of rain. I can also carry only my tent fly and poles, so if it's going to be windy but warm enough, I can shave some weight on that.

Warmer (this one is somewhat debatable, but on a a windy cold day, perhaps less.

If you are trekking you probably won't have too much kit anyway. If you are car camping try and keep as much stuff in you car as possible (its nice and dry in there). Keeping your kit tidy and backed away is generally good practise (I'm terrible at this). In particular, I find if you have a big pile of stuff it is easy to just push to one side/into a corner where it will touch the walls and get wet. If you have one or two bags they are easier to place somewhere sensible. Generally, I keep most of my kit in the inner tent where I sleep. I have a small two man so if it is just me I will lay my bag next to me, and try and keep it off the walls. For larger tents you can also put your bag at your feet. I've also seen people use their bag as a pillow which seems quite good, especially if space is tight. Most larger tents will have a sort of porch area and even small tents tend to have some extra space at the door. You can leave your kit here. If it is a relatively small space lean your kit into the inner so as to avoid the outer. Also if this area doesn't have an groundsheet you kit may get wet from the ground. Finally, as Liam pointed out dry bags are good. If its raining you'll probably get a lot of damp kit anyway so they can help keep your dry stuff separate.\",\n",

Extending the guy-line in the picture farther away from the tent and closer to a horizontal angle is not an effective way to get more outward pull at the top of the hoop, surprisingly. It will pull the sides of the hoop somewhat, but to pull the top of the hoop away from the middle of the tent, the guy line should be perceived as an extension of the canvas eave. So, find the maximum angle which the eave can make away from the tent, and make sure that the guy line pulls toward the ground in that direction. So, you\\'ll stake the guy line to the ground more closely to the tent. When pulling the guy line farther outward doesn\\'t pull the eave farther outward, that\\'s the point to stop looking for a stake point farther from the tent. Once you find that angle, you\\'ll want the guy line to be under as much tension as reasonable. Given the angle, you can see, I\\'m sure, how \"pulling down (and out, but not too far out) on the guy line is the same as pulling up (and out) on the top of the hoop\". So come up with a way to make the guy line tighter. You\\'ll want to ensure that the stake or sandbag or whatever\\'s holding the guy line down is as secure, heavy, or otherwise immobile as you can, and then use various means of tightening the tension on the guy line against that resistance. The tautline hitch knot or a plastic or metal guyline adjuster tab at the end of the line are options. Last, you can also consider adding a guyline directly to the top of the hoop so that you CAN angle a guyline in the horizontal direction (which isn\\'t optimal if the guyline is fixed to the canvas eave). Angling your guyline farther outward lets you take advantage of stakes which have less holding power, but only if it\\'s attached to the top of the hoop and not to the eave. Once the line from the top of the hoop is fast and pulling outward (away from the center of the swag), then you still would use the other guy line, but only for holding the eave out, not for holding the hoop up.',\n",

This way it's more likely, the lightning will hit somewhere else, and if it hits close to you and a tree falls, it's also more likely the tree won't hit you. Maybe look for a dense forest, so the trees and branches can catch the falling tree and it wont fall all the way to the ground. If you are on a plainland or a area with no trees, maybe think about not building up anything at all.

If you really want to insulate your tent, try putting a blanket or old sleeping bag in between the tent and the fly.

With a popup tent, in high winds the stress will be on the tent itself, with guy ropes the stress is on the ropes and (when erected properly) a certain amount is channelled down to the ground via the pegs. Now this isn't to say popup tents will break the minute they hit a moderate wind - but the point I find most people don't consider much is that when popup tents do break, they use such a combination of internal poles / springs that they're near impossible to fix in the wilderness with tools you may have on hand. Quite simply, there's much more to go wrong, and much less chance of fixing it if it does. If you apply this ethos to a dome tent in high winds, if something breaks it's very, very likely to be the guy ropes that go first (because they're what should take the brunt of the force.) If you awake the next morning to find a couple of guy ropes snapped, 10 minutes later they can be near as good as new with a short piece of paracord and a moderate knowledge of good knots. Combining those together I'd say that at lest for serious use, popup tents are not as well suited to high winds as dome tents.\",\n",

       "    'body': \"As others have said, the main advantage of a free standing tent is that it doesn't require stakes or rope tied to external fixed objects to stand up. Of course there are downsides too. This generally means there will be more poles and the tent will therefore be heavier for the same internal size. Personally, I think the advantages only make sense in limited conditions. A free standing tent is great if the only surfaces you have to place the tent on don't allow for stakes and the conditions aren't too windy. That can occur, but in my experience this combination is pretty uncommon. I have a small tent that requires a minimum of 3 stakes to stand. Two more stakes are optional and only necessary to keep the tent anchored in case of high wind. Camping in a forest is not a problem. The forest floor is always spongy enough that installing a stake is simply a matter of pushing it in. It takes about a second and you're done. The most common difficulty I run into with this system is when camping in the desert. The ground tends to be dry hard-packed dirt. It can take a couple of minutes per stake to get them the 6-8 inches into the soil. This usually takes a bunch of twisting and pushing. I can't bang my tent stakes since they are aluminum with a hook loop on top. Banging only deforms the loop. Most of the time I get the stakes in. The worst is when two stakes are already in and I just can't get the third in far enough. That means I have to move at least one of the other stakes to allow re-positioning the last one and trying at a different location. That happens to me about once of the 10 nights or so I spend in Arizona in that tent a year. So far I've always gotten the stakes in at the chosen campsite after a retry or two at most. Sometimes you can pour a little water over where you want to put the stake to soften the soil, but that doesn't really work as well as it sounds. So anyway, a self-standing tent would have helped, but the tent I have didn't keep me from camping in any of those places. In the end, I'd still rather futz with the stakes a little more some of the time than have a larger and heavier tent. Only one time in the nearly 30 years I have been using my little tent did the ground conditions foil it completely, and that was in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. I was on top of Bondcliff when it was time to find a place to set up camp. I knew Bondcliff was broad enough on top and just assumed I could find a place to put the tent. I was wrong. Either there was bare rock or thinly covered rock, or too much of a slope, or thick knee-high alpine bushes. A free standing tent would have worked, although keeping it from getting blown off the mountain would have been a issue. I probably could have dealt with that by using enough rocks for weights in the right places, especially if the tent wasn't too tall. In the end I ended up with my sleeping bag under the stars. I piled some rocks around as a windbreak. That helped, but it was still very windy that night and there was also a thunderstorm. Yes, I and my sleeping bag got pretty wet and it wasn't a pleasant night. Oh well, you gotta have a few adventures in life to look back on and tell stories about too.\",\n",

       "    'body': \"One way I was taught in the uk armed forces (a very long time ago) was to use dry rocks. Heat the rock in your camp fire, then carefully just before bed time, place the rock inside your shelter, the rock releases it's heat slowly and acts very much like a radiator producing a consistent source of dry heat. A word of warning though this method was never designed with polyester tents in mind, it was designed more for the hand made shelters that you may build in a survival situation, and where the heated rocks would be placed on bare earth. With a little bit of common sense however, for example place the hot rock on some logs or a layer of thick sticks, and not allowing it to touch portions of the tent that prolonged contact with t may melt, then you should be pretty much ok. The heat it will generate will be dry dissipated heat such as would be obtained from a radiator or convection heater, so should not in any way damage the tent, also make sure that you heat rocks that are 100% dry, if there is any moisture at all in them then you run the risk of them cracking and even exploding in the fire, it's not funny when it happens either, I know from experience!! It's not a perfect solution, and it does take you a few hours to heat the rocks up, then you also need a suitable way to carry them, because they WILL burn flesh quite easily, but if done with care, it will work and should work well. Update - 23/9/2014 I was just re-reading this, when I remembered something else that's of use in this situation. Many of you who do outdoor type stuff might carry with your supplies some of those reflective Mylar survival blankets (Like the type rescuers use when they rescue people who are hypothermic). Whats often not realized though is these things are not just good for wrapping yourself in, but, if you use a bit of duct tape fashioned into a loop you can stick them up on the inside of your tent above your head and up the sides. Beacuse of the reflective properties a lot of the heat that rises from things like body heat, or other heat sources in the tent, gets immediately reflected back down over back into the main tent space. Also because of the general thermal properties of Mylar, any heat that does make it through will be a lot less than any heat that would escape directly through the polyester/canvas on it's own.

       "    'body': 'There are a few different ways to pitch a tarp. In all cases the challenge, compared to a tent which is full self supporting, is that you need to find enough anchor points to be able to pitch it with adequate tension. In fact often the exact configuration you use will be determined by what points you can find to string it up from. A common method is to string a cord between two trees. This requires one of the knots to allow you to adjust the tension in the cord after it is tied as in this video This line form the ridge of the tarp which is slung over it and then itself tensioned with short cords fixed to the ridge line with a prusik hitch or similar. Then the four corners are tensioned with guy lines to ground level fixed to pegs, rocks or other trees. The most important thing about setting it up properly is to be able to tie the proper knots easily, which comes with practice. This is what allows you to tension it properly so that it sheds water effectively and is able to resist the wind. Tarps are most useful in forested or jungle areas where you can be sure that there will be plenty of trees to tie all the lines to and they are often used in conjunction with hammocks as in this type of terrain it is often difficult to find smooth level ground to pitch tent on and it is possible to set up a hammock and tarp camp on extremely rough and sloping ground where a tent would be impractical. On particular advantage compared to a tent is that it is quite versatile for example it can be set up quite high and wide to provide a shelter for cooking, drying clothes or other admin during the day and then lowered to give a more enclosed space at night. Similarly, with practice and in the right terrain they can be set up and taken down quickly enough to be used for rest break in bad weather. It is also possible to use a tarp as the basis of an improvised tent using poles carried with you or found locally. This can be a useful stop gap if there are no trees etc around but can be an awkward compromise between a proper tent and the bets use of a tarp and if you want an ultralight system you may be better off with a bivi bag, but this very much depends on the precise circumstances you are expecting.',\n",

You've addressed the significant points, but I think the issue can be reduced to two factors: Time required to set up and take down Physical size Canvas will generally lose both due to the added bulk. So why use a canvas tent? As anyone familiar knows, they're amazing when you're inside them. The more hours you plan to spend in the tent awake, the more attractive canvas becomes as an option. For short trips where the tent is primarily used for sleeping, they tend to be more of a hassle than they're worth. The longer you stay, or the more time you plan to spend inside, the less of an issue the time and bulk become. That leaves trip duration as the deciding factor. How short of a stay is too short for canvas? Personally, I wouldn't set up a canvas tent for any stay that was less than three nights, and only then if it was a trip that revolved around the campsite. If it's an average trip with lots of daytime excursions, I wouldn't use canvas for anything under a week. Oftentimes when I go camping with a larger group, one or two canvas wall tents will be set up as the living and dining areas for everyone, while synthetic dome tents will be used for separate sleeping quarters. If camping is about the campsite, then go with a canvas tent, it'll make for a great experience and, if properly cared for, will last a lifetime. If camping is about outdoor activities, go with the synthetic dome tent and spend the extra money on other gear.\",\n",

Apart from that, things you can look for are: Waterproof-ness: This should be indicated on the label, but looking at reviews may help in evaluating the durability of the waterproof coating. Thickness: For keeping rain off your tent, you don't need anything thick. Something thin will be lighter to carry and take up less space in your bag. Durability: Specifically, the holes where you put your ropes should look sturdy. Reading reviews is the best way to evaluate these I believe. Also, the very center should also be rugged, because you may want to place a stick there to keep the center high. Colors: Colors should match the rest of your gear to make you feel smug.

       "    'body': \"There are no easy answers here - even experienced campers can find this a challenging decision and getting it wrong has significant consequences. You will have to clarify your personal priorities and then do a fair bit of research. Portability - the single most important consideration The central issue is portability - most of your other decisions will flow from this. If you are only carrying your shelter for short distances your priority will be comfort in camp. If you are covering the miles, you would be wise to prioritise weight. But once you prioritise weight, you have to decide what you will sacrifice for lightness. Here are the key trade-offs you should consider. The right answer will depend on your budget, the conditions and your personal preferences. Trade-off #1) Weight vs Budget There is a huge range of prices, from cheap generic Asian imports through mid-market outdoor brands up to small artisan and expedition specialists. You have to decide what you are prepared to spend. In general the more you pay, the better the design, construction and materials, and the more performance you will get at any given weight. Trade-off #2) Weight vs Durability & Storm-worthiness In general the lighter and more portable the tent, the more care it will need in use, the shorter the expected life, and the more you have to shelter it from wind and snow loads. Trade-off #3) Weight vs Space, Comfort & Convenience In general, the lighter the shelter the tighter the internal space and the less comfort & convenience in use. So if you prioritise lightness you need to consider what sacrifices you are prepared to make: Do you need space to sit up and spread yourself out, or are you merely looking for a minimal space to sleep in? Do you need bug protection? Are you prepared to go single-skin and put up with some condensation? Do you need a large sheltered vestibule for cooking and gear storage? Are you prepared to compromise on ease of entry and exit? What priority do you give to views? Other strategic considerations But you're not done yet. Here are a couple of other key strategic considerations: Do you carry walking poles? Poles are one of the heaviest components of any shelter. If you carry walking poles you can save weight by using them as your shelter supports. This comes at a cost though. First, your choice is much more restricted and you will generally have to purchase from a small artisan supplier. And second, you will be restricted to less space-friendly geometries such as pyramids and A-frame ridge tents. Do you need a free-standing geometry? If you regularly camp on surfaces that don't take a tent-peg you may need a free-standing geometric design, though even then you will need some guys to support the tent in bad conditions. And now you have to sweat the details... After you make the big decisions you still have to decide on the details. True tent obsessives will be researching: The pros and cons of different materials and coatings for walls and floors The pros and cons of different pole materials and manufacturers The pros and cons of different geometries, pole structures and entrance arrangements. You could literally write a book on the subject, so we can only cover the basics here. Once you are closer to making your choice, search for reviews and get onto the forums - you will find that users are often generous in sharing their experience with particular makes and models. Hope this gives you a helpful starting point. Now it's over to you...\",\n",

Right now I have a silicone coated 9x12 ripstop nylon tarp. Marketed as 'aquatarp' on Amazon. But for a small weight penalty, the coated woven poly tarps you can get at Big Box Stores work. They don't last as long, but if you are just starting out it's the way to go. A long narrow rectangle is less useful. I prefer a rectangle with proportions of about 1.33 to 1 (12 x 9) 1.2:1 (8x10) is about the shortest I've seen. Had a 9x14 one once. (1.55:1) That was several feet of wasted space. Don't go too small. You need a reasonable overhang of tarp. 8x10 is the smallest I would use for solo. If my bag is roughly 2x6 feet this gives me 2 foot overhang at each end, and 3 feet on either side. In actual use, I'm likely to be off center to have ready access to my pack. 10 x 12 is good for 2 people. When I helped run an outdoor program, we would use the cheap Canadian Tire tarps, and try to buy blue one year, then green or orange one year. After a backpack trip, they came back with spark holes, tears, and usually a few missing grommets. For the winter program they would still do. And accumulated a lot more damage. The next fall they would be cut in half, and each pair of people would get one new tarp and half an old tarp. The latter they used as a ground sheet. The prevented two events: If they had two new tarps, both would have holes in them by the end of the week, as they wouldn't consistently use one for the roof. Having a small tarp kept the whole tarp under the roof. More than one pair of kids has come to grief with all the water that landed on the roof, sliding down onto an exposed edge of ground tarp, and soaking them from underneath. Site selection is different: For a tent, you need a certain sized spot, fairly flat, generally about half again larger than the actual footprint of the tent to allow for guy lines. For a tarp you don't have a bathtub floor, so you look for a spot that either has a very absorbent but is currently fairly dry -- big mossy patch, duff under a spruce tree, or you look for a spot that is clearly higher than the surroundings, or you look for material that has good drainage. Because it has so many ways to pitch, you can fit into camp spots that are impossible for a tent. Some of my preferred pitches: Clear weather, rain unlikely. Support all 4 corners 4 feet or so off the ground, with enough general slope that if you are wrong you don't have an overhead swimming pool. Having a tarp overhead means less dew on your sleeping bag. Variation: Kite form: 2 kitty corners high, two low. This sheds water better, but isn't as breezy on a hot night. Typical pitch. Mid point of a short side is tied to a tree about 5 feet up. Opposite two corners are staked down. This provides head room at one end. Put the bags at the bottom end to hold tarp away from your bags. Tree wrap. I've used this one when caught by a snow storm in winter. Take off the bottom few feet of dead branches off a spruce or fir. Tie the middle of the long edge to the trunk about 5 feet up, ABOVE the bottom tier of branches. Tie the opposite edge to either branches, or to shrubs away from the tree. The branches support your tarp. Do NOT break twigs off the top of the branches, as these leave sharp bits that poke your tarp.\",\n",

In The Netherlands, families may camp up to 5–8 weeks per year, car camping on campgrounds in western or southern Europe. They quite often have cotton tents, I\\'d say they are the majority of quality family tents on those campgrounds, such as in the pictures below. During my childhood, we always went camping in summer, for up to six weeks in a row, using a bungalow tent , with the kids sleeping in a cotton tent somewhat similar to the pictures below (only a somewhat cheaper model). Only in adulthood when I started backpacking, did I first learn about the problem of condensation — there is no such thing in a cotton tent. Synthetic tents are really only needed if you carry a tent on the back or the bike. Consider a stereotypical image of a French campground in summer: Source: Camping le clou Or at the coast: Source: NOS All the tents you see in these images are cotton. Cotton is a more durable material, it is stronger and thus more weatherproof, it breathes naturally, it doesn\\'t look soggy when wet. (Incidentally, in my family we call the type of erecting the tent seen in the second image — with the opening away from everybody else — De Waard style, after the brand of tent pictures; a rather introvert way of camping!) There are advantages of a synthetic tent: Much lighter and packs more compactly — essential for backpacking or when flying to holiday destination, highly desirable for bikepacking or taking the train to holiday destination. It\\'s cheaper — when only camping for 2 weeks per year, families might not want to spend €3000 for a tent. In The Netherlands it is quite common for families to camp for 8 weeks per year. Spend 8 weeks per year camping for a tent that lasts 20 years, and a €3000 tent is less than €3/night — not bad when it sleeps 6 and is large enough to stand upright (at least for children) and play monopoly on rainy days. From your question, I deduce that in some parts of the world, such tents are not popular even among families car camping. I would speculate that such families are either in caravans, campers, or \"glamping\", or perhaps not willing to spend the money for a cotton tent. The market probably relies on families having long holidays. Which is consistent with the other answers referring to scouts: scouts do spend 8 weeks per year plus in their tents (I think), which makes the expense worth it. Families who can only go for 2 weeks per year (USA?), not so much.',\n",

Such a tent might save your life if rescue agencies are looking for you. So, to reduce visual impact: choose camouflage. To quicken rescue in emergency: choose anything BUT camouflage.\",\n",

People buy small two man/trekking tents so that it is easy to carry them and one doesn't have this sort of problem. If you are in a larger group then it is not necessary for one person to carry the entire tent. You can break it up into at least poles, fly and inner. Different people can take each section which they should be able to fit in their bags. If you really need to pack it on the outside of the bag no solution is really ideal. The best bet is to attach it in the lower central section of the bag, basically over the bottom zip. This puts most of the weight on the hips and keeps it central. The bag will probably still feel more swingy when you turn as the center of mass is further from the center of your body, but this can't be helped. If the tent bag is small enough you may be able to fit it in the lower compression straps over the bottom zip. This is the easiest way to attach it but not particularly secure. You'll probably want some extra webbing/cord to tie it on better. On your bag the side and lower compression straps and pole hooks all look like decent places to attach extra strapping. If you can't attach it at the bottom you could also tie the tent vertically in the center of the bag or even on top. These are less good as they put more weight on your shoulders and putting on top also tends to restrict head movement (you can't look up). While the side compression strap may look a good place to put the tent try and avoid this as, as you mentioned you'll probably end up lopsided.\",\n",

       "    'body': \"I'm going to answer your question about water column , which is generally given in XY millimeters. This might sound surprising, but generally you can almost ignore the values given by the tent manufacturers. Why? How waterproof a tent is doesn't only depend on 2000 vs 5000mm of potential water pressure, but also about its shape . Meaning certain types of tents (e.g. when the fabric is at a steeper angle) will need a lot less water resistance to be essentially waterproof than, say, a tarp that is installed horizontally. And because you can't often properly compare the different tent shapes, it can be very hard to compare waterproofness. My advice: Go to your trusted local outdoor store, explain them your requirements and your limitations (money, ...) and they will give you some good suggestions on what you could buy. You might want to look into different variables that will affect your enjoyment of the tent a lot more that how many mm of water column its fabric can withstand. Weight is a huge issue in tents, especially when you plan on carrying them (trekking). The problem here is that the lighter the tent, the more expensive it gets - and with 100-150 Euros you won't get far... Size matters. Not everyone has the same requirements here, so think about how much room you need to feel comfortable. Also think about how many ppl you want to bring, how big your packs are, if you want to be able to cook inside (only do this with the right equipment!), etc. Of course bigger means heavier, so there is a tradeoff here... How sturdy it is will mainly define how many seasons/outings your tent will be usable... Judging this can be very hard though, so I suggest you search for reviews online or (again) ask your local outdoor store for advice. Sturdiness will of course also mean your tent can withstand wind and weather better/longer. The shape or your tent will have a big impact on size-per-weight and on the tents stability. Very generally speaking: dome tents are the most stable but heaviest, tunnel tents are often the lightest (for their size).\",\n",

When putting a tent up you may have a bundle of fabric that you need to set down on an uneven surface, sort and erect. Having it in black distinguishes it from the varied colours of the tent walls so you can always place your tent floor down, without having to check all the sections. The floor is the strongest, most heavily waterproofed part of the tent skin, so this also means you are less likely to end up with a damp tent from placing it upside-down on damp ground, or tears from catching branches or roots on a thin piece of tent fabric. Found another reason: Because the floor is manufactured using a different process to the rest of the tent, making floors that matched the tops would require more complicated processes and cost more. A constant black means any floor can be fixed to a top of the correct size.\",\n",

The Fly Creek is extremely light, but I only ever use it backpacking when I'll be the only one in it. It is too small to hang out in comfortably during extended bad weather, and there is only enough head room to sit up in near the door. The tent is widest and tallest in the front, then gets narrow and short at the rear. If you've got two people, the only way you'd both be hanging out is by lying down, and if you don't use mummy sleeping bags, you'd be on top of each other. Unless you don't mind VERY tight quarters, it's a one woman tent, with just enough room for a backpack besides. From what I've seen, this is typical of ultralight tents. Even changing clothes could be challenging if you aren't flexible. Compared to my Eurkea domed tent, the Fly Creek is smaller in every way. The listed dimensions are slightly small, but the differences in how the tents are designed mean that the dome's space is almost all usable for things like sitting and playing cards, as well as sleeping, while the Fly Creek is designed to provide a place to lie down and sleep, and maybe keep a small backpack. The dome is also better at providing a little privacy, because it has windows you can zip up, even if the rain fly is off. The ultralight has large areas of mesh, and if you want it covered, you need to have the windowless rain fly up. If you can get to a store that sells tents, they'll usually be willing to set up a sample for you, and you can see if the light weight is worth the tradeoffs.

Basically grip the exposed end of the bottom pole and twist the pole (as though you want to collapse them). Be careful not to damage the locking mechanism and ensure you unscrew them, not tighten them up more. Eventually you should see the locking mechanism \"wedge\" contract and get thinner. You should now be able to put the pole back together. Hopefully nothing is broken and you can tighten them whilst inside. If not you can try and expand the \"wedge\" a little and try again.

As a habit from military I keep my tent as low as possible when I am only confronted with wind, so I can close the sides with some equipment, rocks, or vegetation. Imagine the previous diagram with the metal poles/wood sticks shortened and moved to the right 1/4 of the fabric length.

Being hit by burning fragments of timber will likely Ruin Your Day .

In a tent, you\\'re lying directly on the damp ground with just a thin groundsheet in between. Ground path currents tend to be much lower than the main strike current (if it was to dissipate evenly across the ground surface, then the current would be inversely proportional to the distance from the strike). Depending on what kind of poles you use for your hammock, you may be increasing the likelihood of a direct strike, but the good news is that such a strike should go straight through that pole to ground. It might melt the pole as it does so, which wouldn\\'t be fun. Perhaps pole caps made of old tennis balls may help protect against that.

The Knobstone Trail is outside your range further south, but is known for its elevation changes, but I still haven't been able to hike any of it.

Nothing in IN is really rocky per se as you would find in true mountain ranges but you may find smaller sections in some areas that have lots of rocks and roots.

       "    'body': 'Hiking isn\\'t too different from walking, except that the terrain may be rougher (depending on the path) and navigation might be more difficult (again, depending on the path). I am in the northeastern U.S. and can tell you that most people already own the equipment to hike many of the most difficult all-day mountain trails in my region. You\\'re not even planning to stay overnight. Stage 1: Short, Flat Walks How far do you walk already? For starters, don\\'t do anything too different. Go to the local city or state park and walk the fraction-of-a-mile boardwalk or paved trail. You could probably do this today. Bring a bottle of water or another kind of drink if it\\'s hot. The type of container you store the water in isn\\'t important, as long as it\\'s light enough for you to carry. Wear sunscreen or a hat if it\\'s sunny. Otherwise, wear whatever clothes you find comfortable, and whatever shoes you\\'d choose if you didn\\'t care how you looked and wanted to walk from one end of your indoor shopping mall to the other. On an even paved trail for a fraction of a mile, you\\'d be OK even if your favorite walking shoes are flip-flops or high heels. If you want to learn more about what you\\'re seeing, read a book about the local nature. I find it enhances the experience. :) Stage 2: A Bit More Rugged Congratulations. If you\\'re having fun on the easiest hikes and want something more challenging, you\\'re ready to do what I would consider serious hiking. A 1-2 mile trail through the heart of a state or national park, possibly on rough and rocky terrain, can really make you feel far away from civilization. Make sure you bring plenty of water and wear sturdy shoes. Sneakers or any kind of sturdy flats are a good choice, and hiking boots are also okay. You might want to wade through streams or into lakes, and choosing stable trekking sandals as your footwear can make that fun. But don\\'t drink the water without purifying it first. Do NOT wear: Shoes that stretch or wobble. Examples: Flip-flops, leather sandals, Crocs, most dress shoes. On rough trails, these increase the risk of ankle injury. You also want to think twice where you put your feet when the trail is rough, and resist the urge to rush downhill. Uphill or downhill, keep a steady pace on rocky trails. To be on the safe side, you\\'d want to hike with a partner starting at this level. Any type of physical activity incurs a small risk of injury, and you don\\'t want to be alone in a remote area if you\\'re in trouble. You would also want to be familiar with the trail markers, and make sure you can clearly see the markers or the trail at all times. (On some trails this is a challenge...) Stage 3: Moderate Day Hiking 3-6 mile trails can lead you through several different habitats, around lakes, or up small mountains. At this level, you can start to really know the hikes in a major state or national park. Make sure you\\'re in reasonably good physical shape before you attempt a hike of this difficulty. You should be very comfortable doing the easy trails. These harder hikes will take several hours, so you should wear shoes that won\\'t give you blisters. Bring meals or snack food (such as gorp) as appropriate. You may also want to bring a flashlight, in case you miscalculate the time and find yourself stuck on the trail after dark. If you think the weather might change, bring or wear layers of clothes. Stage 4: Are You Going to Follow the Call of the Wild? If you\\'re comfortable with the easy and moderate hikes, you\\'re ready to leave your old life behind and spend a full day immersed in a trail. You probably want to wear some of the sturdiest shoes you own - sneakers or hiking boots, so long as they don\\'t give you blisters. I recommend you take yourself to New Hampshire, which the poet Robert Frost called \"one of the two best states in the Union. Vermont\\'s the other.\" http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/robert_frost/poems/733 He wrote this for a reason. You can take one of his (and my) favorite trails. It\\'s unforgettable. http://www.hikenewengland.com/FranconiaRidge081011.html If you hike the whole loop, you will ascend above the Northwoods and reach tundra and spectacular views. New Hampshire isn\\'t quite as rugged as Jack London\\'s The Call of the Wild , which is set even farther north. Still, its motto is \"Live Free or Die\" and despite its small size, it would mess with Texas. Perhaps you will be asking the question \"Hiking: How to stop?\" Don\\'t.',\n",

In terms of total miles, these local trails exist in vast numbers compared to the few well known long ones.

The problem with both of these is that they don't provide topo maps with contour lines. Google maps does provide maps with hill shading, although IIRC they make it a hassle to print them, and you can't get features such as a UTM grid.

Topo maps with trails are available for some USFS lands from the Forest Service .

The UTM grid makes it possible to use them with GPS. An added advantage of the paper maps is that if your GPS unit isn't working (dead batteries, no satellites visible in the sky because you're in a deep canyon, ...), you can still use them.

I'm pretty sure there is a web site about trail conditions, but for the White Mountains of New Hampshire you can get trail conditions info directly at the Pinkham Notch visitor center run by the AMC, the National Forest visitor center in Lincoln, and probably various places you can call including the several you could walk into to ask. Every major park or forest has some place you can call or look on the web. For more obscure places (hiking-wise), it gets less formal. Here in north-central Massachusetts, like in much of the US northeast away from the major hiking destinations, there is a surprisingly large scattering of land open to the public with trails on it. There is no one place to go for info about all of them. Most of these areas are just patches of land with maybe a sign and hopefully a few blazes on the trails. There is no visitor center or any building or any staff, so there is nobody you can call directly and there isn't likely a web site with up to date conditions. For the obscure local trails, you have to use a little common sense. For example, if you wanted to explore the Harry J Rich State Forest in Groton, which is unstaffed with no facilities, you use a little logic and realize it's conditions aren't going to be that different from a few miles away. For example, you might inquire about the Willard Brook State Park in Townsend. Conditions will be similar enough, and someone there may have even recently been out to the Rich Forest. Or find out about conditions in the town. Lots of towns have conservation groups with web sites. These don't generally list current conditions since that would be too much work for the volunteers to keep up with. But, there is usually some contact info. To use Groton as the example again, there is the Groton Conservation Commission, the Groton Trails committee, the private Groton Conservation Trust, each with web pages. It doesn't take much digging to find a email address or find that there is a grotontrails email list. Send a message saying you're from out of town and would like to know the conditions, and you'll probably have half a dozen replies by the end of the day. If you want to hike in Littleton or Ayer or Westford instead, dig around there for web sites and contact information. For example, Littleton has the Littleton Conservation Trust private group, and the headquarters for the New England Forestry Foundation are located there. If you can't find anything for Ayer, for example, look at a map and realize that whatever you find out about Littleton or Groton will be pretty close. These are just local examples that I am familiar with since I live and work here, but this sort of small local patchwork of organizations applies to most of New England, and probably to many other places too.

It is very unlikely you will be able to tell a barely used human made trail from a game trail. Hikers like to be very obvious about the trails they make, and established trails are well worn. If a trail is very narrow, has undisturbed or barely disturbed ground cover, and is a bit overgrown, it's likely to be a game trail. Look at the ground cover. If it looks identical to the surrounding ground, it's more likely a game trail. Look for upturned or heavily compressed leaves (relative to the surrounding ground cover) and footprints. These are signs of human use, although the leaf disturbances might also come from animal use. Animals will use human made trails, so hoofprints don't tell you much either way. If you are somewhere without leaves, just compare the ground surface to the surrounding area. The bigger the differences, the more likely it is to be a human trail. Look at the vegetation up top. If you see broken branches, especially from waist to eye height, it might be human activity. If you don't see broken branches, but there are none to snag your clothes or poke you in the eye, it usually means a person removed them. Look for litter. This is a sure sign of human use. Keep in mind that the trail might just lead to a party spot for locals. Additionally, game trails that do look like human trails usually revert to typical game trails in a hundred feet or so at most.

As @Mark pointed out, you should expect for it to have a few flaws (as will any solution not based on first-hand experience from previous hikers). If you have time to plan, you could minimize this by using street view to see if there really is a sidewalk there. Either way: be sure you're ready to improvise or even backtrack.\",\n",

       "    'body': 'It depends a lot on what exactly you mean by \"around there\". While there are no real mountains in the immediate area around Prague, you can find a number of great places to hike there. If you a willing to go a bit further, you can find some nice mountains, too. Also, I am not sure if by two day hike you mean a backpacking trip with sleeping outdoors, or if you plan to find some other means of accomodation. I can give you some information that is based on my own experience from over 20 years ago, together with chats with friends and information availabe on the web. First, two useful pieces of information everyone looking for hiking or backpacking opportunities in Czech Republic: The country is crisscrossed by an extensive system of inteconnected hiking trails, that allows you to get on foot from pretty much any place to any other place. The system is maintained by the Klub Českých Turistů (Czech Tourist Club) , and consists of two components: trail markings and corresponding maps. Each trail is assigned one of four colors: red, yellow, green or blue. It used to be that red color was reserved for long distance trails, often following a long mountain range or a similar such feature, yellow trails were shorter, branching from the red ones, and green and blue were reserved for local or connecting trails, but as far as I can tell, that is no longer strictly followed. The trails are marked in terain by trail marks that look like a horizontal color stripe (red, yellow, green or blue) between two horizontal white stripes, like this: They are usually found on trees, rocks or buildings, and can look like this . At places where the trail changes direction, it is often marked using an arrow version of the mark: There are several other variations, marking a spring or well, historic ruin, vista point etc. Intersections of trails usually have pointers telling you what direction to take to get to various locations, as well as their distances in kilometers. The other component of the trail system is a collection of maps, that have the color coded trails mark in them. They are usually quite detailed and easy to use. You can buy them in any bookstore, newspaper stand, and in many museum and souvenir shops. The online map server at mapy.cz has a setting that shows the trails as well. The second thing is of interest to backpackers. While it is illegal to \"wild camp\" in Czech Republic, in most areas it is a fairly common practice. If one is smart about it, one can usually avoid detection, and even when discovered, if you clearly behave well, do not damage the environment, do not litter etc, and behave politely, forest or park rangers often let you go. There is some dispute about it, but it seems that it is actually legal to sleep in the woods as long as you do not make a fire and do not build any kind of shelter. There are number of exceptions, mainly in national parks and nature preserves, but in general, you can sleep in woods if you do it in a smart way. Now, back to hiking opportunities near Prague. There are actually several shorter but nice hikes. One of them is the \"Prokopské valley\" . You can either take a bus to the Zlíchov station and take the blue trail up to the valley, or, from Jinonice subway station, yellow and green trails both go down. The valley has a number of interesting geological features. Other interesting areas are \"Modřanská rokle\" on the other side of the river, area around Roztoky and Suchdol in the north, the Botič valley in the east, and several other smaller areas. These are all shorter hikes, partly through urban or suburban environment, but can be quite nice. For longer hikes, and more natural ones, I recommend the region in the south of Prague. It is more hilly, with some prety good hiking. Probably the most mountain like part of this region is the area called Brdy. It is a range of wooded hills that stretch from the southern edge of Prague for some 50 or 60 km south west past Příbram. Unfortunately the central part of this range belongs to the military and is mostly closed to the public, but the northern part has some very nice hiking. There are several ways how to get there from Prague: The main red trail starts at what I remember used to be a small insignificant city bus stop at Zbraslav-Báně . From there it continues the entire length of the \"northern\" Brdy. I highly recommend to follow it all the way to the Plešivec mountain. It would make a good long one day hike. If you want to continue for two days, there are number of places to camp for the night in that area. If you are lucky, you may even find a place with a makeshift shelter and a fireplace. If you do, please treat it gently. There is a tradition in this region to very carefully clean the fireplace when you are leaving, and to leave a small fir branch pointing in the direction in which you left in the middle of it . If zou want to return back to Prague, you can walk down to Hostomice, Jince or another small town and take a local train to Zadní Třebáň, where you switch to the main line and return to Prague. You can also continue further, with several option, perhaps following yellow and green trail further south west. It skirts the military zone, entering it at several places that are open to public, and follows all the way to the town of Rokycany. Another option is to partially backtrack, return to Dobříš, and follow for example the blue trail to the Vltava valley, which has plenty of local hiking opportunities, and generally good transportation back to Prague. Instead of trying to find the red trail in Zbraslav, you can take a train from the Smichov train station to either of Dobřichovice, Mokropsy or Všenory. From any of those stations, you can take a blue trail that will take you up the hill to the main red one. You can also take a bus to Jíloviště, the bus stop should be on or near the main red trail. Finally, you can take a train from the Bráník train station to Dobříš, and enter Brdy from that direction. To get some idea what you can see in Brdy, you can look at this site . Another great area for hiking, less hilly but perhaps more interesting, is just on the other side of the Berounka river. The \"Český Kras\" (Bohemian Karst) is somewhat more popular and can be, at least in some areas, quite crowded, but if you avaid the most obvious tourist attractions, you can find some excellent hinkng. Again, there is a number of ways how to get there: For the longest hike, you can actually continue the Prokopske Valley hike described above. From the central part of the valley, you take a blue trail to Slivenec. In Slivenec you switch to the red trail, and take it to Kalinův Mlýn, where you switch to a blue trail again. (You can also get to Kalinův Mlýn from the upper end of the Prokopske Valley, if you take a blue trail from there. From Kalinův Mlýn, you follow the blue trail pretty much south to Kulivá Hora , where you switch to a red trail towards Karlštejn. Another option is to take a train from the Smíchov station to Radotín (you shold also be able to get there by a city bus). In Radotín, you can get directly onto the red trail towards Karlštejn . You can also stay on the train for a little longer, get off in Černošice and take a green or blue trail from there. Both of them will eventually meet the red trail to Karlštejn. You will then follow the red trail through Karlík valley and Mořinka all the way to Karlštejn. The castle in Karlštejn is a very popular tourist attraction, and can be pretty crowded. Most visitors take a train or bus to the village, and climb the souvenir shop encrusted road up to the castle. The red trail will bring you to the castle from different side. You will still have to pass through some of the madness, but you will avoid the worst. You can visit the castle if you want. Then continue on the red trail past the castle. Keep following the red trail till you get to an intersection of several trails called \"Propadlé Vody\". From there you have number of options, but my favorite always was to take the yellow trail to the north, marked on the map as \"Svatojánský okruh\" (St. John circle). It will take you past the Arnika cave, through some interesting long abandoned limestone quarries all the way to a vist point on the top of the cliff overlooking the St. John valley and the monastery. Bacrtacking a bit and following the trail further will take you down to the valley. From there, you have several options. You can take the blue trail north and catch a train or bus in Vráž. You can stay on the red trail and end up in the city of Beroun, with several options for transportation back tp Prague. Or you can take the yellow trail south to Srbsko, where you can take a train back to Prague. If you want to hike more, you have a number of options, including those: You can pass through Beroun westwards to Nižbor, where another area with numerous hiking opportunities opens: Křivoklátsko . You can spend some time there, or you can turn south through Zbiroh, and eventually end up in Brdy. If you end up following the yellow trail to Srbsko, instead of getting on a train, you can cross the river and the train tracks, and follow the yellow trail throu th ebeautiful Koda valley, then to Koněprusy, where you can visit some very nice and quite famous caves. You can then follow the yellow trail to the Popovice train station, or turn south, and by a combination of marked trails and roads get to Brdy. Finally, my third suggestion is the Sázava river valley. Take a train from the Bráník train station to Pikovice, take a red trail, cross the river and follow it upstream (again, depending on how much time you have, you may want to start closer to Prague, or even in Prague. You can catch the same red trail in Zbraslav or Vrané. In fact, it is just a different part of the same red trail that leads through Karlštejn.) The trail will closely follow the Sázava river, with a nice view of its rapids. You can follow it all the way to Kamený Přívoz, where it will cross the river again. There you will have several options. You can take a train back to Prague, follow a series of green, blue, red and yellow trails back to Pikovice or even to Prague, or continue on the red trail to Prosečnice. From there you can take the yellow trail through Vlčí Rokle (the Wolf Ravine), which is quite interesting and nice. After that you will have a whole scale of possibilities, there are number of trails that you can take, most of them leading you eventually to a train or bus station. Hopefully this will be at least somewhat helpful. Enjoy your visit. Perhaps one more advice: Czechs are generally rather fond of hiking, and many of them know their hiking areas quite well. If you are going there for a conference, for business, of to visit friends, you may want to ask your hosts where to hike. They will probably be able to give you a better, more current advice, and perhaps they will even go with you.',\n",

The first 4 miles have little shade, we saw the occasional mass of snow in shady spots off the trail. The last two have a lot more shade--and even those of us with poles and microspikes decided it was unsafe to continue.) 2) Ask the rangers in the area(s) you are considering what the conditions are.

       "    'body': 'This is impossible to answer unless you are willing to do an enormous amount of research. There is no single, or even just a few, databases of trails in the US. The national trail lists generally only contain the larger multi-state trails (like the AT, PCT, etc) and some of the larger regional trails, but these are the tip of the iceberg. I\\'m guessing, but the total length of trails is likely 100s if not over 1000 times more. For example, here in Massachusetts, we have the AT running thru the western end of the state, and some locally well-known regional trails, like the Bay Circuit, Midstate, and M&M trails. Look around on some national lists and see how many of the regional ones are listed at all. Then consider that the bulk of trails in MA are actually much shorter trails in individual towns. The Midstate Trail runs north/south thru MA, connecting NH and RI, and is 95 miles long. Here in Groton alone, we have over 115 miles of trails, and that\\'s just one town. Groton may have a larger trail system than most, but even if the average is only 25 miles per town, that still dwarfs the lengths of the national and regional trails in MA. However, you\\'re very unlikely to find more than a tiny fraction of these local trails listed anywhere nationally. This state of affairs is slowly changing, but even that is happening piecemeal at the local, regional, and state levels. A comprehensive national database is decades away at best. Even an MA state-wide database is years away. There have been individual efforts, but none comprehensive yet, although there is at least some talk about that. DCR (the MA Dept of Conservation and Recreation, owners of the state parks and forests) has now just within the last couple of years compiled a list of trails on their properties. Some of the regional planning agencies have tried to compile lists of trails within their regions. For example, the Montechusett region (roughly north central MA) has a region-wide trails map, but that doesn\\'t contain every last trail in all the towns. It\\'s also too low resolution to make that practical anyway. Groton does have a comprehensive map of all trails in town, but no really definitive measure of all their lengths. Our claim of 115 miles is an estimate based on reasonable assumptions, but not on comprehensive accurate measurements. I\\'m on the town Trails Committee and am actually working on that. I\\'m going around measuring all our trails with a measuring wheel, and taking GPS tracks at the same time. I\\'ll eventually get to all of them, but that will probably be another 2-3 years out. And, even if I say so myself, we\\'re well ahead of most towns in the state. Most don\\'t have Trails Committees, so local land trusts and other private organizations and \"friends of ...\" groups maintain their specific trails, with not even a town-wide website, master list, or any one group responsible for such things. The reason I\\'m telling you all this detail is to put the problem in perspective. To get a complete list of trails in MA, you\\'d have to gather information from several federal and state agencies, dozens of local land trusts, and various other official, private, and volunteer groups in each of the 351 towns and cities. After you\\'re done with that, you only have the remaining 99.72% of the US land area left to do.',\n",

However here are some pointers to get you started -- I've linked to pages that might help you but the parent websites are worth a browse. In general French websites assume some familiarity with a map of France -- regions are often shown out of context -- as well as the names of the various organisational areas. france-randos.com has search facilities and the ability to browse by region and département (I started with Alpes-de-Hautes-Provence; Alpes-Maritime is another good option). In the resulting list I found the GR4. Descriptions of the GRs can be found at gr-infos.com , here I've linked to a section of the GR4. This map (link rather than inline image as no rights information given) has a nice overview of the GR network, suggesting that the GR5 might be worth a look for you. Sources on the regional GRP (grandes randonnées de pays) routes are almost by definition regional, and again hard to find online. Some regions have paper guides available. French Hiking maps of any decent scale tend to cover a fairly small area, but the 1:100 000 maps are fine for the GRs which are all waymarked on the ground as well as shown on the maps. I suggest getting hold of a few maps once you've narrowed down you search a little.

The one I used for years was put out with help from the Sierra Club. The guide books have the U.S.G.S. maps in them with the trails marked. The maps themselves often don\\'t have the trails marked. Acadia National Park in Maine has many guidebooks with maps for special areas: the carriage trails, the hiking trails, etc. So, if you are going to a specific area or park, research like crazy online for sources of maps. Individuals may have websites with custom maps. Think outside the box: Birding groups may have their own maps that may show feature not on other maps. Waterfall groups have their specialty maps. Geocaching.com has their own maps. It is better to do some work before you go somewhere so you are prepared so you can be safe and so you don\\'t miss anything special.',\n",

Lebannon Hills Regional Park is a personal favorite of mine, and a hike around all the lakes within the park will be a solid day hike. Otherwise, most of the best unpaved trails out there-at least the ones that are upwards to two hours way-are going to be located North of Minnesota. The Lake Superior trail tends to divide itself into multiple pathways allowing you to either take a light easy hike or a more moderately intensive hike. If you are fine with some smaller trails as well, I would recommend taking some time traveling a bit north of Duluth to take a short walk around Silver Creek Cliff and Fifth Falls located at Goosebury Falls. Both are pretty short hikes, but both are worth the trip! They are not very well known compared to the main waterfall area in Goosebury falls, so they do not get visited by very many people. A little closer away to the Twin Cities is the Ice Age Trail , in St. Croix Falls. The total trail is 1,200 miles, stretching all the way through Wisconsin. The length of the trail, however, crosses into a lot of popular state parks, so there are segmented trails you can do in a day\\'s hike. If you have time after the hike, I would also recommend checking Taylor\\'s Falls located across the riverside. It\\'s a popular rock climbing spot and has some \"Bottomless\" potholes that offer an interesting view. Traveling a little down South East, you can head towards Red Wing and check out Frontenac State Park . This park has two loops on the North and South end of the park. I would recommend getting there early if you want to go to this park, because by mid-day, a lot of people tend to fill up here.

It\\'s famous for being the oldest hiking trail in the United States, having been built between 1910 and 1930. According to the Green Mountain Club , which is referred to as the organization which has protected and maintained it since the beginning: The Long Trail follows the main ridge of the Green Mountains from the Massachusetts-Vermont line to the Canadian border as it crosses Vermont’s highest peaks. It was the inspiration for the Appalachian Trail, which coincides with the Long Trail for 100 miles in the southern third of the state. Built by the Green Mountain Club between 1910 and 1930, the Long Trail is the oldest long-distance hiking trail in the United States. (Emphasis mine.) A different souce lists it as the same number of miles, and the same area. However, it calls it a \" hiking path \" in Vermont, then the oldest long-distance \" backpacking trail \" in the United States. (Emphasis mine.) The Long Trail is a 272-mile long-distance hiking path in Vermont, which runs the length of the state. It is the oldest long-distance backpacking trail in the United States, finished in 1930 by the Green Mountain Club. (Emphasis mine.) Since that source made a distinction between types of trails, I\\'m curious what that means. Unless I\\'m mistaken, hiking path and hiking trail are pretty much the same. What interests me is why one source would also call it a backpacking trail . In this instance, does backpacking trail mean something different from hiking trail? If so, what\\'s the difference?

       "    'body': \"You say you go to wild places to get away from trails, but that is actually the root problem. One purpose of trails is to funnel all the human use to narrow areas to minimize the overall damage. Lots of places have policies that you need to stay on the trail for this reason. This is especially important in high use or fragile areas. Examples of the latter are alpine tundra areas. It can take 100 years for vegetation to recover from trampling. So since you're not the only human on the planet, stay on trails except in the special cases where usage is low and damage from footsteps is minimal. We simply don't have enough wilderness to allow everyone to walk wherever they want to. Staying on the trail is one of the sacrifices we all have to make most of the time to leave the wilderness largely the way we found it. Conversely, trails are things we have to accept as a necessary part of the wilderness. There are exceptions, of course. Lots of people can scramble over the same bare rock without meaningful change. Many places in the desert are fine for wandering around since so few people do compared to the size of the land, and you can mostly walk on rocks or bare dirt such that a few footfalls are pretty much irrelevant. But in the general case, the answer is you don't get to do that at all. Check the local regulations about off-trail hiking. Here are some examples. This is Franconia Ridge in the White Mountain National Forest of NH. You are supposed to stay on the trail here, and they take it quite seriously. Just a few footfalls can kill the sparse vegetation, and it takes a long time to grow back up here above tree line. The trail is well marked and is heavily used. It is not only a popular area in its own right, but is also part of the Appalachian Trail. If even just a few percent of the people that came by here wandered around off trail, this area would be just bare rocks and dirt in short order. The summits are all patches like that because people do wander around a bit. On the other hand: Here you can walk around all you want. In fact you have to because there aren't any trails. But as you can see, it's easy to walk where you're not causing any lasting harm. You may leave a few footprints, but after the next rain or after enough wind they will be gone with basically no evidence you were ever there. This happens to be in the Eagle Tail Wilderness in southwest AZ. So few people go there that it's OK. If 100s showed up daily, then different rules would need to be made.\",\n",

After boots, when you feel like you want to upgrade and get some more creature comfort hiking accessories, you should look at investing in breathable technical clothing , a water bladder , trekking poles (poles make a huge difference on your legs in the long trails or steep climbs, and save your knees on the descents), and gradually get larger and larger backpacks as you find your going out on longer and longer hikes.

Coming from Michigan you might combine that with a stargazing visit to Cherry Springs State Park (weather permitting, of course).\",\n",

The first is generally much more acceptable since it\\'s unlikely anyone will be following your tracks. The second can cause real problems in high traffic areas. As the population grows, more and more areas are becoming high traffic areas, and the rules will have to change if we want to preserve both access and habitat.

       "    'body': 'There are quite a number of options, although the 4000 foot requirement pretty much limits it to the White Mountains of NH, the northern Green Mountains of VT, and a few peaks in ME. It\\'s not clear if you want to or need to do a out and back, or if you can spot a car and do a traverse. Here are just a few options that come to mind without looking things up on a map: From the end of Sawyer River Road in Crawford Notch, hike up Carrigain one day, stay the night, and back down the next. There can be some good views, although I don\\'t remember now if the old fire tower on top has been taken down or not. There are great views from there if it\\'s still there. This is fairly easy for the alloted time. You can arrive in afternoon on the first day without it causing a problem. I don\\'t know about waterfalls, but there will be some stream crossings before you get onto Signal Ridge. Take the Ethan Pond Trail from Crawford Notch to Thoreau Falls. From there you can go down by the falls, south, then west, then north again over Bondcliff, Bond, Guyot, Zealand, past Zealand Falls Hut, and back to Crawford Notch. This is quite ambitious, but doable if you start early in the morning and are in good shape and willing to do a lot of hiking for the alloted time. You\\'d probably spend the night partway up Bondcliff. The upside is you go by several falls, and the top of Bondcliff is probably the most spectacular place to stand in the White Mountains. I screwed up once and ended up spending the night on Bondcliff. I don\\'t recommend that. Plan better than I did. If this still isn\\'t enough of a challenge, you take the Zeacliff trail \"shortcut\" down from Zealand Mt instead of going by the hut. I did that once too, and decided it should be a up-only trail, so I also don\\'t recommend that. Go to some of the waterfalls on the west side of Crawford Notch, but keep going instead of back to the parking lot like everyone else. There are ways to loop around and come out a different place in Crawford Notch. There should be at least a couple of choices here you can find by studying a map. I don\\'t have one in front of me, so can\\'t say much more about this off the top of my head. There are various options for one-night backpacks in the Carter-Moriah range east of Pinkham Notch. For example, start going up the Nineteen Mile Brook Trail, then pick a way that loops back to the road eventually. There should be three basic choices, with the southern one including Carter Dome. There are lots more possibilities. Get a map and look. However, one thing you probably don\\'t want to do is Franconia Ridge. There are some pretty waterfalls on the Falling Waters trail, but there are no good places to camp on top. Either it\\'s above tree line or within a exclusion zone, pretty much all the way from Liberty to Garfield. This is also the most crowded backcountry area in the White Mountains because of the number of trails providing access from Franconia Notch, and the presence of Greenleaf Hut. If you\\'re looking for a ambitious but certainly doable day hike, then this works better. One possibility is up Falling Waters, north along the ridge over Lincoln, to LaFayette, down to the hut, and back to the same parking lot via the Bridle Path. You get great views for quite a ways along Franconia Ridge, which is above treeline from Haystack to just above the hut on this route. If you do this, bring winter clothes in your pack. You won\\'t need crampons in the summer, but a good rain/wind shell, wind pants, extra wool sweater to put under the rain shell, goggles, and gloves is NOT overdoing it. The weather can change there very quickly on short notice. I\\'ve started out in shorts and a T shirt from Liberty Springs in the morning, and was wearing full winter gear except for crampons by the time I got to LaFayette. At that time 20 mile/hour sleet was blowing in my face, and I was very glad to have goggles on. This was in August. Yes, it can do that, and you can\\'t see it coming due to Kinsman Ridge on the other side of Franconia Notch.',\n",

Do not bring a pound bag of peanuts) Sun Protection (Sunscreen and hat) First Aid Kit (Get a hiking one from REI or Sports Chalet) Rain Gear (Just look at the weather before hand, but if you have a light waterproof jacket, just bring it anyway) If you want high quality equipment, probably got to a nearby REI. For shoes, hiking boots are definitely recommended. I know my boots saved my ankles at least three times from being twisted on my most recent backpacking trip and I am still young. For daypacks, it depends one how much you are carrying, but approximately 25 liters of space would work great. For trekking poles, if you are going up and down steep hills, one or two would be very helpful. I am a runner, so of course I recommend running in preparation for hiking. When you run, you place way more weight on your legs than just your body weight. Also, over-preparing for hiking will allow you to enjoy the area you are hiking through much more than if you are absolutely exhausted. Try to run a couple of miles a weekend and you will be great for a few mile hike. Of course you don't have to run, but it would still help considerably for the hikes.\",\n",

The similarity with the word \"Variant\" in English makes me think these are other options for this hike. While these are in red and blue they don\\'t seem quite like what you\\'re asking about. 2) This is a normal topographic map. Follow each bold line (I suspect these are your red lines but I\\'m not completely sure), you will find an elevation listed. Note a bit to the northeast of the origin point of this trail the line is labeled \"600m\". From this we can conclude that the trailhead is at approximately 600m above sea level. The last bold line before your destination is labeled \"2000m\". Note that there are four unlabeled and lighter weight lines between each bold line. (These are probably your blue lines but the lines are fine enough that I am very unsure of their color.) These divide the 100m spacing between bold lines into 20m increments. The lodge at your destination is 2 fine lines above the 2000m line, thus we can conclude that it is 2040 meters above sea level. This seems a much better match for your question but I am not sure the colors are right. These lines make it clear this trail will climb 1420 meters. (Note this closely matches what Google says to the left: 595m to 2041m.) Also, from those lines we can see that the first part of the climb will be reasonably steep, followed by a walk across the slope that is nearly flat, and then another climb at the end.',\n",

For a look into the book, including sections of text, see here . It also comes in an audio book and was made into a movie in 2015. Bryson hiked with a friend, and although he skipped many sections (i.e., did not complete the trail), he had a great experience. The book is a great read, informative and funny . The reason I suggest this book is: your mother sounds as though she is relatively inexperienced for a trip as long as the Appalachian Trail. Backpacking for one week is hard, but backpacking for six months is not just a longer hike, but a qualitatively different hike. (A Snow Leopard is not just a bigger long-haired cat than a Persian, but a qualitatively different cat.) Bryson's book will put the trip in perspective in a way that no maps or hiking guides could. Naturally, your mother needs to study the maps and hiking guides, but she knows that. The above paragraph is not meant to discourage your mother or to make you anxious. Your mother has an admirable goal, and I will be thrilled if you report back that she arrived at Mount Katahdin next fall -- a thru-hiker on her first try! In addition, I will repeat my comment: your mother should: (1) take a Satellite Messenger or PLB ; (2) observe bear precautions with food, but otherwise not worry about bears; (3) get at least some rudimentary medical knowledge (if she does not already); (4) arrange to talk with you and/or a friend at logical points along the way. (Once a day is too often (she needs to get away from it all) and probably impossible anyway.) If your mother opts for a satellite messenger, (4) is to some extent redundant with (1) as far as safety goes, but would be good for her mental health and yours.\",\n",

Also I just learned about the \"Märkische Schweiz\", a small low mountain range. I have never heard of the 66 lakes trail, so I can´t give you information on that. Note that you can reach the baltic sea in about three hours, maybe that´s something you would like? General tips During my research, I was quite surprised how scarce information is in English (I am german). However, at most tourist bureaus people should be able to speak it, so phoning or mailing them is a good idea. You can try that directly in Berlin or at the suggested places (links follow). If you already know, where you want to hike (the 66 lakes trail e.g.), you can ask them directly for places to sleep. Berlin itself is a big city with some nice places for short walks, but nothing I would call hiking. Around it lies the state of Brandenburg. It is mostly flat, has few forests and a lot of agriculture. Due to this, cycling and paddling (where possible) are more popular, hence my question if you consider that. Despite this, there are two major long distance trails passing by: the E10 and the E11 . Here you can find general information on the E-trails and here on their particular way in Brandenburg (in German, sorry). Spreewald Very beautiful lowland forest. Most people go here to kayak along the small streams and channels in the Spree. There are cycling trails as well as dayhikes. The E10 crosses here (Werben till Groß Köris would be the etaps), so there should be a marked long distance trail. If I would be to hike near Berlin, I would give this a try because it is by far the nicest nature in this area. There are a lot of small villages and, during summer, tourists and it is far from wild. There are a lot of places where to sleep, it can be a little expensive though. Here is their tourist information - all German, but you should be able to contact them directly. If you are also interested in history/culture, I would definitely give it a shot, since it is one of the few areas in Germany where there has been preserved some kind of folklore. Get here : ~ 1.5 hrs to Lübben or Märkisch Buchholz by train, about 50-80kms. Mecklenburger Seenplatte An area with a lot of lakes: Made for paddling and cycling. However, the E10 passes by, so there should be some hiking possible ( I just read that it hasn´t been realized yet between Strasen and Stralsund, which would contain the part through the Seenplatte. This information might be outdated, but please check with the tourist bureau! ). It would be a good idea to get in touch with their local tourist information, since there are some less densely inhabitated areas where its nicer to walk. They also provide some information in, well, lets call it \"semi-english\" on their homepage . Get here : ~1.5 hrs to Neustrelitz by train Märkische Schweiz A nature reserve with a lush forest, some rolling hills and lakes. For information here (again, in German - sorry!). The E11 seems to pass it. You can probably ask also in Berlin about it. This is a description of the latest \"Berlin Hikers\" day hike in this area. Get here : ~1 hr by train (switching to a bus brings you closer to the forest, but you can walk through fields instead) Hope you find this information helpful - maybe you could give a small update about your choice and experience afterwards? EDIT3: Some small improvements for the \"Märkische Schweiz\" area (Eyal) EDIT2: After @bashophils suggestion I will add the Saxon Switzerland and steal his links. Saxon Switzerland The Saxon Switzerland is a low mountain range very popular for rock climbing due to the large amount of cliffs. In my personal opinion it is one of the most beautiful places in Germany. A big part of it is a national park. Two options for hiking there would be: Following the Malerweg , a 8-9 day round trip. You can easily pick only a part of it, I specially can recommend etaps 2-5, but I don´t know the last ones. You have to pay attention where to sleep, though. Getting a room in the area, e.g. in Bad Schandau, and do a couple of dayhikes from there. Both possibilities will surely provide a unique experience. I didn´t mention this area at first, because it is rather far away and doesn´t belong to the Berlin region. Also, it really merits a visit on its own (like the nearby state capital of Dresden). Get here: ~ 3(fast train) hrs /4.5(slow=cheaper train) hrs from Berlin to the start of the Malerweg or to Bad Schandau in the heart of the area. EDIT1: I just realized I should probably mention that all this is not about \"untouched nature\" but more or less cultivated lands. I would not call this suggestions a place for an outdoor experience, but more for a couple of nice dayhikes since you will have to sleep inside. Nevertheless, it can be beautiful, just don´t expect wilderness.',\n",

There are ten or so refuges in the park, in which you can eat and sleep, but I think camping is also permitted under some circumstances. There are plenty of trails through the mountains, so a number of routes are possible. There\\'s a famous circuit called the \"Carros de foc\" (Chariots of Fire) which covers a couple of the refuges and takes up to a week, so that might suit you. And the park\\'s beautiful- I can attest to that. I slept in a refuge located on a peninsula, surrounded by clear lake water and mountains- I wish I remembered the name, but I think it\\'s in the picture in the top of this (possibly useful) web site.

       "    'body': 'Adding on to the other excellent answers, here would be a few of my additional tips: Try to pay more attention to the difficulty of a hiking trail before committing to running it. Consider working your way up by running on forest service roads and flat trails before moving to more mountainous trails. Trail etiquette is even more important. Announce your presence in safe locations when you want to overtake a slower group of hikers; don\\'t run full tilt around corners. That there\\'s no shame in walking cannot be overstated enough. Always keep in mind that \"getting to the summit is optional; getting back is mandatory.\" This brings us to... Give some thought to how quickly a minor problem can escalate. A twisted ankle, blisters, running out of water, or an afternoon thunderstorm can be very problematic if you find yourself miles from the trailhead with minimal gear. Always let someone know where you\\'ll be and when you plan to return! One piece of gear that I highly recommend is an ultra-light wind-breaker such as the Patagonia Houdini or Mountain Hardwear Ghost Lite . These jackets pack down incredibly small (I\\'ve fit mine in the sewn pocket on a hand-bottle) and provide just enough protection to keep you moving if adverse weather rolls in. I like to bring along a couple Katadyn Micropur Purification Tablets on a run. Much lighter than carrying a second bottle of water, work reasonably fast, and can help prevent running out of water (provided that you can find a stream). Consider getting shoes designed specifically for trail running. In comparison to road runners / sneakers, trail running shoes generally offer more stability, more impact protection, aggressive tread, and stickier rubber. Again, breaking a toe or a slip-and-fall can be more consequential when you\\'re running in the mountains.',\n",

From there, you can stay high and head toward Randle Corral and Blue Canyon, or you could descend into the amazing and secluded Tehipite Valley and the Middle Fork Kings River. Either will lead you further East into the High Sierra. Now for the bad news. I explored this at least 15 years ago, and never did find any trace of the Rodgers Ridge trail. It may have been established decades ago and only persists on paper. From a route finding perspective, this is not all that terrible, as the topography clearly directs you (\"Just Go Up\").

       "    'body': \"Switzerland has a nationally consistent policy for hiking signs with Swiss precision (for example and inspiration, see this impressive 64 page guide on signage ), as required by law . This applies whether in the high mountains, on easy forest trails, or (usually short segments) on rural roads. You might find a sign indicating it's 5 hours and 55 minutes hiking to a particular destination. In total, 64784 km of routes are signed, of which 21856 km in the mountains and 17723 km on surfaced roads (For more information, see wandern.ch in German or French ). Signs are present not only in tourist or nature areas, but everywhere; you can hike from one border to the other by following the signs. Note that Switzerland is rather densely populated, and certainly on any of the trails of the easy category, you're never more than an hour or so from civilisation, and probably the furthest you can get anywhere from the nearest road is a six hour hike or so. It doesn't really have anything that would be classified as wilderness, except in the truly hard-to-access areas where no signed routes lead. Hiking signage uses either metal signs at intersections, posting the time in hours, or metal indicators mounted to trees (they used to do that, but not any more) or other objects, or, in the mountains, paint. They have three categories, and the colour indicates the category: A Wanderweg (hiking trail) is easy and indicated in yellow. They are found mostly in lowlands. ( Wikimedia Commons, Paebi ) ( Wikimedia Commons, Irmgard) A Bergwanderweg (mountain hiking trail) requires mountain boots, and is indicated with white-red-white stripes, either on a sign, or in paint on a rock. They also use cairns. (Source: Wandern im Bregenzerwald . Note that this is actually in Austria , but in this case the signage is identical in Switzerland). Finally, there are Alpinwanderwege (alpine routes), which require alpine experience and may cross glaciers, extended zones of boulders, be very steep/exposed, etc. Those are indicated in white-blue-white, or (just like the Bergwanderwege ) with cairns. (Source: Wandern.ch ) Intersections between trails usually have the aforementioned metal signs, and indicate the different categories. For example, here users can choose between a glacier-crossing route, a mountain hiking trail, or an easy interpretive trail: And often they include time estimates as well: Opinions differ, and for a while, the big hiking destination of Zermatt replaced all the metal signs by wooden signs, for aesthetic reasons, but they have now reverted to metal signs. Personally, I love them, but I may be biased because for me, it was in Switzerland that I learned to love mountain hiking. There are a couple of other, newer categories as well, such as cultural routes and prepared winter hiking routes (not backcountry skiing), but those are far less common. Some more information can be found on the Wandern.ch site in German or in French , including a 64 page guide on trail signs with lots of pictures .\",\n",

Some of the regional and even long distance trails are famous as century-old historical trade or pilgrim routes and connections between cities. Which points to a very different origin of those famous trail compared, to more or less recent recreational/dedicated hiking trails such as the Alpe-Adria or the Kungsleden on the one hand and e.g. rescue trails like the Juan de Fuca and West Coast Trails (famous, North America, regional). And in consequence, they are woven into the local network of roads and paths: Personally, being at home in that dense Central European network of hiking trails, forest paths, roads and field tracks we have in the German hills, so far I have hardly ever considered \"doing\" such a regional or long distance hiking trail - although I\\'ve been on lots of them: as we have a full network of trails and paths the way I approach this over here is that I grab a map, think from where I want to hike to where and then decide to follow this trail from here to there, then turn on that one, then... and so on. In consequence, names of these trails are very much a side note to me. In contrast, Canadian Juan de Fuca Trail had just a few access paths that one could take to get to the close by road (its original purpose was helping shipwreck survivors to get out of the forest), and Matario Trail (of local fame, I was in a group of a few people, but we did not meet anyone else) basically stretches between two access points with the only diversion being canoe portages. The bottom line is that for these trails, there decision is pretty much to hike them completely or not at all. So if you go hiking there, you do the Mantario Trail, whereas you may do the Rennsteig, or do part of the Rennsteig and then turn somewhere as you like. Remember, the original purpose of the Rennsteig was to give access to various towns. And this was achieved by the Rennsteig being a through-hiking trail along the crest of the Thuringian forest plus various side trails leading down the valleys to the towns (thus achieving the connection climbing up and down only once pretty much between any two of those towns). And nowadays regional tourism offices make that there are so many named trails that really it is easier to remember just where to go without the name. Just looked it up: on Sunday I actually crossed Limes trail while on the Luther Trail (both listed as a European long distance trails). In that sense I\\'d say that regional marketing in Central Europe has lead to such a proliferation of trails that the importance of the individual trails is much diluted (with the exception of maybe a very few very famous ones). I think this is good, as I\\'m talking about a region with > 200 inhabitants/ḱm² which even on that vast number of trails and paths is definitively not going to be lonely on the average Sunday. Another consequence is that the old trade trails and some of the long distance trails sometimes run along major highways (or at least their original route is now a major highway) and they even cross large cities due to the historical routes they follow. But I have to admit that crossing Berlin on foot along the E11 does look like a dreary piece of work to me even though they reasonably kept to parks. For me that is certainly a reason to cherry-pick only the nice parts of a trail and not consider doing the whole thing.',\n",

To the extent that you can, I recommend packing things you will actually hike with. One, the weight is more representative, and two, the weight is going to be dispersed more realistically for actual hiking. If you train with other things in your pack just for weight you are more likely to train for a pack that's off balance. Buy and learn how to use hiking poles. They really do help, even starting out. If at all possible, exercise doing something you like, or in a place you like. If training is just misery you go through to learn to hike, you're less likely to train (and hike). Pick the day, time, and place that you are least likely to skip every week. Pick someone to go with you who will encourage you to never miss a hike. If you seriously overweight, I would suggest first shedding the pounds by taking up swimming. This will greatly reduce the strain on your knees.\",\n",

For more details, you might find the answers to this .SE post about planning a day hike useful. For multiple day trips, consider the following in addition. planning Since you have mentioned Heidelberg, I would like to point you to the site www.wanderbares-deutschland.de (I'm not affiliated). This portal collects hiking tours in Germany, you can search by region and difficulty. They list useful information like the symbol/marking of that tour, description of the trails (bituminised or natural), height profile, recommended stages, touristic highlights, etc. Hence, I guess it might be useful for your planing. sleeping You did not mention your ideas regarding the nights, hence I will go a bit into detail here. First, please notice that in some German states camping offside official camping sites might be illegal or only allowed after asking the land owner's permission. So, if you plan anything like this, get familiar with the rules in the area you want to go to. Depending on the season, there could also be hunting in the forests, which might be annoying, scaring or even dangerous. You surely don't want to be mistaken by a hunter as a boar on your way to the bush during the night. Although I can really recommend the experience to sleep outside (with the proper equipment!), you could also consider sleeping in youth hostels or pensions. Besides the comfortable bed and the hot shower, this had the advantage that you would need to carry less baggage (sleeping bag, tent). You could have a decent breakfast and dinner there and fill up your water bottle, get food for the day. Hence, no need to carry around cooking equipment and much less food and water. This will make the trip much easier. dangerous situations I think most dangerous is either to lose your way or to get hurt (sprain your foot for example). To prepare for this, know your map and how to read it. Do not rely on your cell phone only, there might be areas with bad or no mobile reception. Hence, I recommend to share details of your tour with a reliable(!) friend or family member. Agree with them that you let them know when you have reached this day's destiny (or where you are, if not) - and make sure they call the police / emergencies if you did not call in time. Get an idea what you would do if you have to abort the trip. Would you know how to reach the next station of public transport and are they running at the weekend? Could you get to the next street/village and call a taxi or similar? My first on-my-own trip was from Darmstadt to Heidelberg in five days - and even if I had blisters and a sickening smell that was one of the best things I ever did. I hope you will make a similar experience - minus the blisters ;)\",\n",

Most information is in Spanish, but an English language manual is available here . Each hike receives four grades on a scale 1–5 according to four categories: Environment. Is there a high risk of landslides? Are there many places where falling off the trail may be lethal? Does it reach areas that are far away from rescue? MIDE lists 17 risk factors. A trek with at most one risk factor is rated 1/5, and a trek with 11 or more is rated 5/5. Orientation. Is the trail easy to find, large and sign-posted, or does the hiker need to be proficient with map, compass, GPS in order to find the route? A route that needs no map, such as a major trail following a lakeshore, is 1/5. Dead reckoning full of impassable obstacles is 5/5. Terrain. Is it a large track where one could walk with city shoes, or are there many rocks on the trail, perhaps some minor scrambling is required? City path or road would be 1/5. Seriously difficult scrambling bordering on climbing would be 5/5. Exertion. Basically the length of the trail. Is it steep? Is it long? Less than an hour would be 1/5. Ten hours or more would be 5/5. The linked guide contains detailed instructions in how to specifically grade a route for each of those. There is also an online application (in Spanish) to calculate MIDE scores. Although the system is Spanish, it would appear that, perhaps with some adaptations, it should be possible to adapt the system world-wide.',\n",

Our family, including my 6 year old has covered enough trails under 3 miles in Crocs. Having said that, I do most of my shorter hikes in running shoes, and longer ones (6+ hours) in hiking shoes. Water : depending on where you hike and how long the trail is, you will need water. From our experience, it's minimum 1.5x of what we normally consume for the same time period. Our most recent hike was a 6 km round trip moderate difficult trail. For our family of 4 (2 adults, 6 year old and 3 year old -- the little one was carried about half the time), it took us 6 hours, and we consumed 3L of water in total, with plenty of juicy fresh fruits complementing the hydration need. Even then, we were thirsty by the last 30-45 minutes and could certainly consume another 500mL-1L in total. If there is running streams or lakes along the way, it is possible to capture and treat that (e.g. filter and/or chlorine tabs) if you really don't want to carry all the weight. I've only done it during back country camping. Food : we usually bring trail mix, crackers and fresh fruits for snack. For longer hikes or hikes near meal time, we also bring bread and canned or cured meat for sandwiches. For starters, I don't recommend fruits with pits or canned food, as you have to bring the waste out with you on most trails. Tools if the trail is sufficiently marked, you can probably do without map and compass. Don't assume you'll have cell phone coverage for map and directions if you're outside urban area. A Swiss army knife or other multi tool is nice to have. I'd also bring a flashlight just in case. Lightweight waterproof jacket with hood should be good enough to cover most weather conditions for 3 seasons. Kleenex/TP for cleaning if you want. Sunscreen and bug spray as needed. Hat is almost always a must. Backpack Since you're bringing water and food and gear, you'll want a comfortable backpack. Any would do, as long as it's comfy. As long as your legs knees are not totally busted (and even that isn't necessarily a deterrent for some people), you can almost certainly hike. Just start with shorter, easier trails.

For example, I often use a Android tablet with a built-in GPS, and software that can record waypoints and tracks on pre-loaded maps. So the answer is, record the lat/lon coordinates of the spot you want to come back to. It can also help to record a GPS track on your way in and out. You can follow these tracks or get to the spot later without any alterations of the land. Unless you own the land or otherwise have explicit permission, Do not Leave flags. Make cairns. Cut blazes. Make chalk marks. Do anything else that mars the land, rocks, trees or anything else, or leaves a deliberate visible trace of you having been there. All these are vandalism and just plain rude without permission of whoever has authority over the land. And no, it being public land doesn't give you the automatic right to do these things, at least not here in the US. Also consider that maybe you shouldn't even be off a existing trail in the first place. Wandering around freely is allowed in many public lands, but staying on established trails is required in others. Don't assume you can wander off trail without making sure it is actually allowed on that particular property. More on chalk marks Some apparently believe that it's OK to go one someone else's land and mark it up with chalk, and even worse, indicate a whole new trail. In most case, that is not so. I would be upset if someone did that on my land. Even in cases where the public has permission to walk on the land off-trail freely, marking a new trail still isn't right without explicit permission. In my town, there are no general restrictions on walking around on town-owned conservation land. I am on both the Trails Committee (who does the planning, construction, and maintenance of trails) and the Conservation Commission (who is the authority that would grant permission for a new trail on such lands). I can tell you we'd take a dim view of anyone marking a new trail with chalk. While the chalk marks alone are vandalism, the real issue is the new trail being marked. Others will likely see it and follow it, and now it becomes marked just from the wear of usage. It also gives others the impression that it's OK for anyone to mark a trail. This is not a sustainable situation, and would make work for the volunteers that manage the conservation lands and the trail system. Most people not on the Trails Committee or the ConCom have no idea about what restrictions there might have been imposed on a property when it was acquired, deals made about trails with other entities holding CRs (conservation restrictions), research and thought that went into NOT putting a trail in a particular place, future plans for where trails will be, where particularly sensitive environmental areas are, etc. Someone just barging in can cause real damage. It can also derail negotiations between different groups about trail placements and the like. What I mention above are not just academic points. These things have actually happened. In one case someone put a bridge across a ditch to make it easy to cross. We were in the middle of trying to convince the CR holder to allow us to put a bridge there. As you can imagine, a bridge suddenly appearing there without permission didn't go over well. Now all the trails in a whole section of that parcel are not allowed to be maintained and are essentially closed. In another case, a trail was proposed and had gotten as far as being flagged with yellow tape, all with proper permission. It was then found this went too close to some vernal pools where the endangered blue spotted salamander was found. It was decided to not route a trail thru that area, and all the flags were carefully removed. We don't want anyone even giving the impression of a trail near those vernal pools. Again, you simply don't have the right to mark a new trail on someone else's land without permission. Here in the US, you must assume that permission is not given unless done so explicitly. Making a few chalk marks may seem harmless because they will be washed away after a while with no real environmental harm, but again, that's not the point. How would you feel if I put a bunch of chalk marks on your house? Sure, they'll wash away after a while, but that doesn't make it right.\",\n",

First and foremost, travel on the trail. Concentrating travel on trails reduces the likelihood that multiple routes will develop and scar the landscape. It is better to have one well-designed route than many poorly chosen paths. Second, choose where you tread on a basis of durability. How much will the ground you are walking on be affected by your footsteps? In order of most to least durable: Snow/Ice: these will melt and/or be snowed over before the season is over, effectively leaving zero trace of you ever being there (if there is enough snow). Rock, sand and gravel: These are not easily affected by footprints and are considered highly durable. Prioritize rocks whenever possible to lower your impact on the trail! If you have to step on vegetation, choose durable plants to step on. Big roots are fairly resilient, and dry grass will survive being walked on, whereas flowers and moss will quickly suffer. Avoid vegetation whenever possible, especially on steep slopes where the effects of off-trail travel are magnified. Cryptobiotic crust (this is the first time I heard about this): according to the LNT guidelines linked above, blackish crust on sand is a tiny community of organisms that help retain moisture and protects from erosion, so, like moss, it is especially destructive to step on it. In the case of moss, avoid stepping on it because it is especially slow to grow back. Water/mud holes: go through those mud holes, not around. Avoiding the muddy areas, alongside every hiker before and after you, only widens the trail and affects all the vegetation around it.

Most people consider 2-3 miles per hour a leisurely pace. 4-5 mph is a fast pace, almost a jog. If you plan to hike by yourself, make sure someone knows where you are going and approximately when you are supposed to be back. It's a good idea to learn at least basic land-navigation techniques and to use them, even on well-marked trails. If I'm going more than a couple of miles, I also like to pack a small emergency kit with a knife, bandage, flashlight, firestarter, camping toilet paper (biodegradable), hand sanitizer, antibacterial ointment, bug repellent, and some food.\",\n",

       "    'body': \"One excellent idea is a trip to the sanctuaries owned by the Mass Audubon Society . They have an exciting program called The Accessible Trails Project . Our goal is to connect as many people as possible to the nature of Massachusetts. Our trails are extremely welcoming for all – whether you are an individual without a disability who is a beginner on our trails, or you have any sort of disability that may have kept you from the trail in the past, we aim to design these trails to be welcoming to the entire community. All 20 Mass Audubon sites with Nature Centers have Americans with Disabilities Act compliant parking, entrances, admission areas, educational activity spaces, exhibits, galleries, and restrooms. They each also offer at least one Accessible trail, which is mostly flat, and not too difficult for people with walking impairments. As of this writing, more than half have trails designed to accommodate people with disabilities at all levels, especially those who can see only partially or not at all. These are All-Person's Trails, or Universally Accessible Sensory Trails. These trails are designed and constructed first to physically meet or exceed Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance, and then to incorporate universally designed interpretive features including educational stops, wildlife viewing boardwalks and platforms, picnic and play areas, and navigation resources including audio directions, guide ropes, curbing, and handrails. Mass Audubon's Accessibility page gives details and pictures. This page lists the sanctuaries with Nature Centers, and the notation of those with these newer full-featured trails. At all of these equipped sanctuaries, the Nature Center provides everything you need. At the admission window, you can pick up trail information including a guide in printed or Braille format, and a printed or tactile (raised topographical) trail map. They have adaptive items available for loan, including hands-free binoculars (on a tripod), audio players, a walking cane with a small seat, and a push wheelchair. There are some basic criteria for All Person's Trails, so you can choose any location on the map that's marked as providing them. They're all over the state. All Person's Trails are typically 0.5-0.75 miles in length and include: Smooth, gentle grades for improved access by foot, stroller, or wheelchair Sensory-rich audio tours (available by cell phone and/or audio players) Braille texts and tactile maps Tour booklets and maps designed for high readability for visually impaired and sighted visitors Improved signage (also Braille) along trails Wider boardwalks with bumpers as needed Post-and-rope guiding systems. The guiding systems includes beads along the ropes. Round beads indicate the location of a narrated stop where you will find a sign within reach with the stop name and number in print and Braille. A square bead indicates that there is seating nearby. Interpretive content focusing on the natural and cultural history of each site Accessible outdoor wildlife observation structures, specialized gardens, seating, play areas, and picnic areas Here are a few examples of these trails, including the rope guide which blind people can use on their own: One great sanctuary is Drumlin Farm in a lovely town close to an hour west of Boston. While not visually-impaired, I do use a cane, walker or wheelchair, and have been very comfortable there. They have fun things for people of all ages. There are animals, farming, learning gardens, and a nature center. Daily hayrides from April through Thanksgiving include a fun, educational property tour. They have two loops on their All Person's Sensory Trail systems. This page has a full description of their accessibility options. There's also an audio tour feature, which has downloads of 8 stops on the Ice Pond Trail, which takes you closer to the water and woods; and 12 stops on the Farmyard Loop, which takes you closer to the animals. You can listen to it or download it. Ice Pond Trail: Ice Pond Trail is a woodland walk along the edge of a small pond, running from the parking lot to the admissions window at our Nature Center. This trail provides a quiet spot away from the busier sections of the farm. While the trail does meet ADA guidelines for grade and surfacing, you may find portions to be steep or strenuous. As with all outdoor trails, please watch your step, since surfaces may be wet or slippery at times depending on recent weather conditions. Distance: 350-foot accessible pathway Features: A five-foot wide crushed stone surface. A guide rope is provided along the entire Ice Pond trail, attached to the top of a fence. Round beads along the rope indicate the location of a narrated stop where you will find a sign within reach with the stop name and number in print and Braille. A square bead indicates that there is seating nearby. Farmyard Loop: This trail takes you from the main entrance at the Drumlin Farm Nature Center, past the wildlife exhibits and the many barns and animals of the farmyard, and back to the Nature Center. Visiting all eleven stops on the Farmyard Loop trail takes about 30 minutes, although you can easily spend one and a half to two hours enjoying the animals and natural habitats along the Farmyard Loop. The trail also includes several optional detours to the wilder areas of the sanctuary, some covering rougher ground, which you are welcome to explore if you choose to. Distance: 0.4 mile round trip trail Features: The surface is a combination of nine-foot wide paved walkway and hard-packed road. The path slopes downhill from the Nature Center between markers 8 and 10, with benches available for rest stops at the steepest sections. There is a picnic area after stop 17. Audio Tour: There is an audio tour for both segments of our accessible trail. You can access the audio tour three ways: You can call 781-443-7154 on your cell phone. This tour is available by phone April through December. You can download the Audio Tour from the website and play it on your personal audio player when you visit. You can borrow an audio player at the Nature Center admission window. I hope this gives your friends at least something to consider. Hopefully other people will offer more suggestions.\",\n",

They likely have established methods for trail marking that should be followed, and using other means may even counteract their conservation efforts. In many areas, marking trails is illegal. See this article for an example. Marking a trail may confuse people more than it helps. You probably do not know who uses the area and what alternative paths and destinations exist. People who set out on one of these alternate routes may come across your markers and be led astray. For example, there is a trail I hiked a few years back that many well-intentioned hikers had placed cairns on. Unfortunately, so many people had done it on so many parallel and perpendicular paths that it had obliterated the trail and made navigation without a map nearly impossible. Anyone who hikes there now bushwhacks through a cairn infested land because they can't find the trail at all. Re-establishing the trail would require a titanic effort for whoever undertakes it due to the misguided actions of the cairn-placers. On a personal note, ribbons, paint, and bits of plastic are garish and make me cranky when I see them in the wilderness. I don't believe I am alone. If I want to explore a poorly marked trail, I bring a map and revel in the lack of trash (or as some might call them, trail markers ) littered around the trail.

There aren't too many significantly steep sections, so I don't think you'll have too much trouble. That being said, if you are worried about your or her ability to do this hike, consider a practice hike or two on a weekend to get more comfort with the distance and the weight of an overnight pack. That way any issues can be ironed out when you're not trying to hike from one side of a state to the other in 3 days. From what I understand, you are trying to do the Appalachian trail in Maryland, from border to border. That would approximately be this path according to Google Maps. While there's a discrepancy on the exact mileage (I'd assume that the AT organization is correct on that), the elevation max and min are consistent, where the trail ranges from ~230' to ~1880'. According to the Google Map trail, you can expect about 8,300 feet of elevation change in each direction over the course of the trip. I haven't personally done the entirety of the state, but I've done at least 50% of it, and I don't remember it as particularly difficult hiking (the AT Conservancy rates it from Easy to Moderate). In my old BSA troop, we used it as a transition from 1 night hikes into multi-night hikes, so for more experienced hikers, I don't think 10-13 miles is unreasonable. I would definitely suggest getting the appropriate trail map for the section(s) of the AT that you are planning on hiking, as they are very useful for both navigation and planning. In some ways, I think it's easier to plan days based on where there's a good place to sleep (such as at one of the AT shelters) rather than evenly dividing the days. What looks to be the largest elevation change is when entering and exiting Harper's Ferry, where the trail drops to its lowest point. Below is an approximation of the elevation change based on Google Maps. I would recommend a proper trail map, as it will likely be more accurate and will have much more detail, especially when it comes to showing how steep a trail is relative to other sections of the trail. You can buy the full map from the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (note, I am not affiliated, I just know they sell very good maps for the AT and have used them many times).\",\n",

The tool has some nice core features, with the most appealing (for me) being able to mark some points along a desired route and make the tool figure out a route through those points along certain characteristics. The characteristics can be divided into horse riding vs. hiking and then into generate a preferably flat route, allow some ups and downs or include even via ferratas.

       "    'body': \"I'm fairly new to the Seattle area and have been attempting to plan my own early season trips, both for one day hikes and overnight backpacking. I'm certainly no expert, but here's my experience so far. I've been looking based on the following criteria, and using Washington Trails Association hike details and trip reports as a guide, as you mentioned: Avoid areas that are still snow covered, or avoiding camping where snow is lingering. If you are comfortable hiking on snow or are into backcountry skiing, this is less of an issue, but it is easier to stay warm and safe by avoiding deep snowpacks. Usually you can reference recent trip reports, or historical TRs from previous years both on WTA and around the web and see when the snow typically melts. This season was 'average' with a burst of snow towards the beginning of spring. Stick to lower elevation. An easy way to pick a hike that will be warmer and less snowy is to stay low, for example below 3-5k elevation seems to be reasonable this spring depending on the hike's location. There's many hikes in the PNW that follow a river in a valley, I'll mention some specifics further down. Watch the weather. NOAA is a great resource for tracking rain/snow level and temperature at different elevations by using their point-forecast. Give it a general location and then click on the region/elevation where you plan to be traveling, which is on the map displayed on the right side of the website. In the early season we've still had snow storms at higher elevations and sudden warm-ups have lead to avalanche concerns and bulletins posted by NWAC. Be conservative. Early season means a wider range of temperatures and more varied weather. Be prepared to bring 'shoulder season' gear for staying warm and dry, for example, extra layers, jackets, fire making and emergency supplies. Select something that isn't going to push your limits as much, in case the trail is covered in snow and you spend time searching for the trail. Creek fording or river crossings may be more difficult than advertised because of snow melt and if any significant damage was done to a trail over the winter. A few specific hikes: Since you mentioned Olympic National Park, here's a few that I've been interested in but haven't done, though I have done other day and overnight hikes in the Olympics and Cascades. It's worth mentioning that bears encounters may be more likely in ONP due to lack of hunting. Elwha River . I haven't been here personally but it is a low-lying hike of moderate elevation gain, which starts just south of Port Angeles. There are multiple campsites along the way, making for a good out and back backpacking trip. Upper Lena Lake On the eastern slopes of the Olympic range, this hike ascends first to Lena Lake, and then continues to the upper lake. The upper one may harbor some snow still but sounds doable. Enchanted Valley Requiring a bit more of a drive, this hike starts neat Lake Quinault, on the south western edge of the ONP. Also a hike through a valley, though bears are known to frequent this area, no one has had trouble in recent history. WTA's early season backpacking list which includes Hoh River, Cape Alva, and Slab Creek. Olympic Coast. I've backpacked a portion of the Olympic coast and it is enjoyable practically all year. It's worth noting that most hikes in ONP require a permit for overnight camping. I'd love to hear more suggestions as well, based on region rather than specific hikes. There's so many great hikes here, it's hard to go wrong picking something conservative in terms of elevation gain or distance.\",\n",

Plan ahead and get information on what water levels are likely to be like given the time of year and the amount of snow this year. If a certain hike is likely to be impossible to complete safely, you want to know that and not do it. If I know a big crossing is coming up, I start looking for one or two good sticks to use for balance. (I don't hike with trekking poles.) If the creek is high enough or fast enough to look dangerous, I try to discipline myself to spend a significant amount of time searching around for the safest place to cross. The safest point may be 100 yards away from where the trail hits the creek, and may be invisible from the trail. The safest point is usually the widest, because the water flows most slowly there. Sometimes in 10 minutes of searching you can find a tree or rocks to get across without wading at all, or you'll see another hiker who will tell you a better place to cross. Unclip belly band and pectoral strap so that if I fall, I won't be trapped by my pack. Make sure sleeping bag, down jacket, etc., are inside a trash bag or something. I usually hike in running shoes. To cross a stream, I take off my socks and remove the inserts from the shoes, then put the shoes back on to protect my feet while crossing. Although river rocks are mostly smooth, a foot injury could ruin my whole trip, so I don't want to cross barefoot. While crossing, rehearse what you have to do if you get swept off your feet. If this happens, shrug off your pack. The big risks of death are head injuries and getting trapped underwater. To reduce the chance of a head injury, try to orient yourself so you're going feet first. After crossing, hike 10 minutes and then put the socks and inserts back in the shoes. One of the biggest problems with hiking boots is that if you wear them for foot protection while crossing a stream, they will probably never dry out, and you'll end up destroying your feet with blisters.\",\n",

While it is true that there are less hikers in early June than later in the summer, there are reasons for this. Black flies can be quite annoying then. June is also wetter and muddier than early September. Avoid Labor Day weekend, but there will be fewer hikers immediately after that. September weather tends to be dryer with more clear days than other parts of the summer. Personally, my favorite time to hike in the White Mountains is from Labor Day until peak leaf season. That's in early to mid October, depending on elevation and weather specifics of that year. Timing isn't the only way to avoid crowds. Most of the people will be on the AT, or doing day hikes on a few of the popular trails that afford a out-and-back to some nice vista or other destination. The White Mountains has a large network of trails, with most of them not crowded at all, even during peak season. So don't do the Presi-traverse on the AT. You'll meet lots of people and have a hard time finding a place to camp at night. Instead, make a loop over more obscure side trails. It helps if you can spot a car, but there is also a shuttle bus system for hikers run by the AMC. I've done two and three night loops in the middle of summer west of Crawford Notch and hardly run into anyone once I got past casual day-hike range from the trailhead. If you insist on going up to the Presidential ridge, especially near Mt Washington or Lake of the Clouds or Madison huts, you're going to run into people. But that's only a tiny fraction of the available trails, especially if you have the flexibility to not have to get back to a trailhead for three days. Take a good look at the maps. Get the AMC maps printed on Tyvek. Those really do hold up well to water and other trail-abuse. The AMC does a decent job of keeping the trail information on those maps current.

I like to find trails, areas, that are less crowded in general, and estimate the seasonal pattern mostly on availability. Signs of less popular areas: A relative lack of photos on things Google Photos, Flickr, Instagram, etc. A relative lack of uploaded tracks on sites such as Wikiloc and Alltrails . A relative lack of google hits for places uniquely along this particular trail. A general lack of information online. A lack of services in the area. Trails not mapped on Openstreetmap; for example, as of 2020, Openstreetmap maps only two trails skirting the corners of the Bob Marshall Wilderness in Montana (USA), but the National Geographic Trails Illustrated map (which can be browsed online) betrays a relatively dense network of trails throughout the wilderness. Look through some of the websites listed at the answers to this opposite question on Travel Stack Exchange , which essentially asks what's hot right now . My most recent hike was at spectacular Børgefjell ( photos ) and I met nobody, and indeed, it's completely black on sightsmap , as is the part of Iceland I hiked in the year before ( photos ). Check the Strava heatmap , or other heatmaps. If you can't see the trail you want to hike, it's probably not too crowded. If I had looked at the Strava heatmap for the Grand Canyon Corridor Trail (extremely bright), I could have mentally prepared for the hundreds of trail runners 24 hours per day rather than expecting the total number of hikers to be limited by the total number of overnight permits. Compare quiet Grasslands National Park or deserted Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument (invisible — Americas best kept secret?). Although running is not a perfect substitute for hiking, it surely correlates. Note that The same color only locally represents the same level of heat data , so although this method may find relatively less crowded trails in the same state park, you can't compare between areas far apart. I don't know if/how the Strava heatmap works when there is no mobile phone coverage (does it upload later or is it marked as unvisited?). Of course, this has the marked disadvantage that it's also harder to find those areas at all. It helps to know the area, to get a good map that includes not only popular trails but also less popular ones, etc. In northern Scandinavia, I've almost never met another hiker in routes that I designed on my own (though in some areas I have frequently come across people fishing or hunting recreationally, unaware that a specific area had been recently recommended in a popular paper fishing magazine that I don't read).\",\n",

There is a ranger station on the trail at the Oasis Visitor Center (on US41) at south end of the preserve which can provide detailed information on trail conditions and hazards: Address: 52105 Tamiami Trail, East Ochopee, Florida 34141 Phone: 239-695-120 Map: https://www.nps.gov/bicy/planyourvisit/maps.htm If you\\'ve not done much camping, you should consider sticking to established campgrounds.

Most of the trails in the area have at least a knee deep crossing every hour.) These trips would be the first intro to the school I worked at. A 7 day trip would cover from 80 to 120 km and 15 to 30 thousand feet of elevation change. Trails ranged from horse trail, seismic cutlines, to bushwhack. Standard operations: Everyone wears a thin pair of poly propylene socks under a pair of wool socks. The first day we stop after 1.5 hours walk, and everyone removes shoes and socks for a foot inspection. Hot spots are taped. Kids are taught what to look for. Adjustments are made in how they tie shoes. Repeat again at lunch and mid afternoon. Second day we only do it at noon. Third day we remind people to check their feet at noon. At the top of a pass we remind people to pull their feet back in their shoes, and tighten up the forefoot lacing. At the bottom we remind them to loosen up again. Everyone brings two pairs of footwear. In general we don't recommend boots, but rather high top runners unless the student has a rep for rolling ankles. In evening after set up chores are done, everyone changes into dry socks and their second pair of shoes. Some students and staff have tried sandals. Lot of problem with grit. I have tried high top water booties. This works well if you have tough arches. Crocs or sandles are ok for camp shoes. When we know that feet are going to be wet all day, a slather of vaseline before socks in the morning slows down the foot wrinkling and cracking. With this protocol we usually got through a week long trip with 20 people with under a half dozen actual blisters.\",\n",

       "    'body': \"Among the great answers above, some touched on the price of electronic maps and their inadequacy for hiking (e.g. lack of topographical data). To this point, I'd like to highlight the Mapy.cz project (mobile app at https://en.mapy.cz/zakladni?mobilepromo=1 link) which may have started as a regional Czech app, but now covers most of the world with freely downloadable maps. While it lacks somewhat in features like car navigation, it is indispensible for walks and hikes, knowing the majority of official trails and many smaller forest roads, as well as heights, so you can for example profile the planned route in terms of ups and downs you are going to take. From version to version it is less reliant on the internet availability to find things and plan the routes, though I don't think it is fully autonomous yet. All that said, I wouldn't trust my phones of the past decade to navigate me for more than a daytime's walk: their batteries only last as you commute from home to work or back; much less so in cold weather (like under +15 deg C, 100% to 0% in 40 minutes if the phone is not touching my stomach) or in hot summers (+35 degC outside, under sunlight, it wants to shut everything off because the CPU is at 50 degC). So you still need to take a look at the map (digital or not) before the trip and expect that this memory of your main route, and nearby alternatives, and notable points to orienteer by (mountains, valleys, towers, bridges, etc.) would save your hide if you don't take a paper map (or lose it, or it is too dark/rainy/... to read it when you need it). You don't have to be in the mountains or wild outback to get lost, can do so in a city too ;p Do assume the worst, to be ready for it. And hope it does not happen too often :)\",\n",

(1) In the northern part of New Mexico (anything north or, say, Socorro, the Forest Service campgrounds will be closed November 1st until April 1st. (2) If not closed, you will generally have to supply your own water. OK - options for you. First, instead of the Sandias, I might suggest the Manzanos, the range to the south. Get off at the Tijeras exit of I40, go south, and there are a series of Forest Service campgrounds along the east side of the Manzanos. The first is Fourth of July campground, with some nice hikes right there. Further south is Red Canyon campground, with a nice loop including a side trail to Manzano Peak (over 10000 feet). Besides @OlinLathrop's suggestion of Mt Taylor (great views, lots of snow right now), there are a variety of campgrounds on the south side of I40 along the Zuni mountains. I've done less out that way, but there is plenty of hiking there as well. Somewhat off the beaten path, but El Morro National Monument is less than an hour south of Grants NM. They have a campground (although it does not seem to be mentioned on their web site anymore - you should call first) and some day hikes there. Along the road are various turn offs in to the El Malpais (mostly BLM land), with hikes and caving in the lava tubes (great fun). But, for the true New Mexico experience, I would direct you to Chaco Canyon. It will be about 2.5 hours from Albuquerque, with the last 30 minutes on a pretty good dirt road. The camp ground is open year round, and water is available. There are 4 back country trails in addition to the great house ruins in the canyon. The loop (3-4 miles) up the north side of the canyon to the Pueblo Alto complex has fabulous views of ruins in the canyon, as well as to the north into Colorado. The longer (7 miles) hike to Penasco Blanco at the end of Chaco Wash takes you by many petroglyphs. Both can be done in one day, if starting early. And, providing you have talked to the rangers before hand about the road conditions, you can exit the park to the south, meeting up with I40 near Gallup (the north entrance dirt road is pretty good, the south may require real four wheel drive). My two cents.\",\n",

After spending a lot of time in Parks, where there are a lot of rules, and comparing them to growing up in the lawless wilderness, I have to admit that the Parks are a lot prettier. Visiting the wild trails and campgrounds from my youth now is kind of disheartening, because the lack of regulations has basically destroyed the areas compared to how I remember them as a kid. This question really ventures into Leave No Trace ethics. Even if you\\'re not in a Park or forest reserve, the fact that you can go off trail shouldn\\'t serve as an invitation to indiscriminately trample around in the forest. Even the wild animals will make trails and stick to them, that\\'s what most of the trails in the woods back home were; game trails made by elk, bears or mountain sheep. If I\\'m venturing into untamed forrest, and find a game trail, I\\'ll typically follow it for as long as I can. As a rule of thumb, always stick to the trail, especially in frequented areas. In places where venturing off trail is allowed, try to do your best to minimize your impact on the forrest floor. Back home we had a lot of deadfall in the lodgepole pine forests. So we could actually move through the woods without touching the ground by walking on the fallen logs. Avoid stepping on vegetation, especially soft mossy fragile areas, and look for routes that follow more rocky ground. To answer your question, be responsible and do your best to make sure you\\'re familiar with the rules for the area you\\'re in. If you are in an area where hiking off trail is permissible, please be respectful, minimize your impact on nature while you do, and for the sake of future outdoor enthusiasts; Leave No Trace .',\n",

This particular forest preserve is about 4 miles long and 0.25 miles wide with a small river/stream running through it, and has lots of deer within its boundaries. My initial guess about this new rule is that perhaps because of the small size of the preserve and the amount of people frequenting it, they needed to create this additional restriction to minimize the wear on the surrounding land/habitat.

Most trails have evolved from usage patterns before anyone went out to deliberately make a trail. Trails that are deliberately designed as trails are the results of lots of tradeoffs. There are many criteria that go into deciding where exactly to route a trail. Some are: Access to points of interest. Limit the slope. People generally don't like steep trails. They are also more difficult to maintain. If you are designing a handicapped-accessible trail, then you have to be careful about maximum grade (among many other things). Ease of cutting the trail. Ease of maintaining the trail. Trying not to create erosion. You really don't want a trail going straight up a slope, even if the magnitude of the slope is acceptable. Use will make a rut. Then water will run down the rut making a bigger rut. In the end you created a new streambed, not a trail. Then people walk along the sides, making a even bigger mess. To avoid particularly sensitive ecological areas. To keep things like nearby houses out of sight of the trail users.

If you do actually convince them, it will be a process. They will have standards that new trails must adhere to, various policies and procedures that must be followed, etc. They will certainly want to choose the route. You might be able to help or have influence over that process, probably depending on what they think of you. They will most likely want to do the construction with their own trail crews.

They're not too old — you can find maps less than 10 years old in the new digital series, at scales down to 1:25,000. In general, what's on the map exists and is accurate. Unfortunately: most hiking trails are missing. They can be hard to get outside Spain, but can be ordered online and shipped abroad (at least inside the EU). We order them directly from Spain. There are a number of stores selling them, googling for tienda mapas topograficos may help. For example, see Tienda Verde . It helps if you know some Spanish and phone the store directly, for some stores may simply ignore your e-mail if you write them in English. Even passing your e-mail through Google Translate improves the probability of success. For hiking trails, you need to complement the maps with either: A good hiking book Online-downloaded trails. The good news is that Wikiloc is very popular in Spain. Pretty much anywhere you'll go you'll find hundreds of GPS-trails. Even if you do not use a GPS-receiver, you can use those in combination with your map to find out where the trails are. It requires good planning and it's helpful to have access to internet while on your trip. To get an impression of what the maps look like, use the free online tool Iberpix visorign . This is a pretty good tool to interactively explore topographic maps of all of Spain, including the islands. I think it's also possible to display trails with the IGN-map as a background, but I will double-check that.\",\n",

Second day, my feet were in pain and I couldn't do more than 13 miles. Third day felt better and I had no problem covering 20 miles. Last day was the toughest though, for one thing the last 16 miles are all rocky and it was also very hot. Feet were bit swollen and each step was painful. After that, it took about 2 to 3 days to recover and walk/run normally again. My advice would be, if you plan to do only few miles a day, you'll do just fine.

       "    'body': 'I\\'m not sure what exactly makes a trail more blind-friendly as apposed to something like wheelchair-friendly, so I\\'ll answer for handicapped-accessible trails in general. The vast majority of trails are always going to be more rugged and not aimed at people with handicaps that prevent them from traveling over rough ground. This is not due to some elitist deliberate exclusion, but due to the realities of cost. Handicapped-accessible trails simply cost much much more to build and maintain than typical \"wilderness\" trails. However, the trails community is well aware of handicapped needs and tries to address them when practical. This has been a major topic at the last few Massachusetts State Trails Conferences (yes, there are such things). I\\'m on the Town of Groton Massachusetts Trails Committee, and can recommend two particular trails in town: Nashua River Rail Trail . This is a paved trail built on a old railroad bed. It goes from Ayer center into Nashua NH, with about 8 miles of it passing thru Groton. A good place to access it is from the parking area off of Broadmeadow Road (42.6049N, 71.5720W). Going south from there to the Groton School Pond and back is a nice outing with a lot of nature around, but flat and easy. John Tinker Trail on Nod Road (42.6286N, 71.5841W) into the J Harry Rich State Forest. This was just built last year. It has a packed stone dust surface suitable for wheel chairs and strollers. It is only about ¼ mile long, but is completely in the woods, with a beautiful view over a old oxbow of the Nashua River at its end: The trail is deliberately winding in places, giving you as much of a \"in the woods\" experience a trail of that width can provide. There are granite benches at intervals, and a wide area with more benches at the end to make a picnic spot. As I mentioned earlier, handicapped-accessible trails are expensive. When we cut a new trail, a few volunteers can do ¼ mile in a couple of hours. There is no direct expense, other than the small \"Groton Trails Network\" markers we put up at intervals as blazes. Even with a directional sign at a junction, the total monetary cost would be under $50. In contrast, the John Tinker trail cost around $30k and took much more work beyond actually building the trail. 80% of the cost was paid for by a state trails grant, with the town funding the remaining 20% directly or thru in-kind donations of volunteer labor. Some private donations were received, and over 80 hours of volunteer labor went into preparing the trailbed for the contractor, so in the end little town tax money had to be used. Just preparing the trail surface for the contractor to do the heavy lifting took a army of volunteers over 80 man-hours. Then there were many hours by a single dedicated volunteer (the chair of our Trails Committee) who wrangled all the permissions, found the contractor, dealt with restrictions due to this being a possible archeological site, wrote the grant application, organized the aforementioned army of volunteers, etc. This single ¼ mile of trail was a major project for the committee for most of a year. You simply can\\'t have a 110-mile trail system and dedicate this level of resource to each ¼ mile.',\n",

       "    'body': 'I live about 35 miles northwest of Boston, so I can answer this. The first thing you should do is join the Boston Chapter of the Appalachian Mountian Club (AMC). Once you are a member, you will have access to the extensive list of hikes they run. There will be a bunch in the White Mountains of NH, but also many shorter but closer local hikes in areas you\\'d probably have a hard time discovering by yourself. As for above treeline, that\\'s not so easy. There are a few smaller \"mountains\" in the area that happen to have bare tops, but that\\'s not because the climate prohibits trees. Either enough soil hasn\\'t formed on top since the glaciers (only 12k years ago) covered everything, or people cut them down and they haven\\'t grown back. Mt Monadnock in southern NH (Jaffre, not quite as far as Peterborough) is bald on top, but not because it is above \"tree line\". Going further north there are some more bare summits, like Cardigan, but again, not because of weather prohibiting trees. The highest point in MA is Mt Greylock in the NW corner, but it is forrested on top (except for the parking lot and area around some buildings). The closest areas to Boston that are truly above treeline are in the White Mountains. There is true alpine tundra on Franconia ridge and the higher parts of the Presidential Range. However, this area is more than 2 hours drive from Boston, although not that much more. There is no single answer to finding places to hike. The more well known, popular, and grandiose places are well covered by the AMC maps. The White Mountain Guide Book comes with 4(?) maps that cover the White Mountain area nicely. The AT and other well known trails are there, but also many smaller less well known but very nice trails. These are all on the AMC maps. Personally, I wouldn\\'t bother getting the guide book. You can buy the maps seperately, which is really what you want. Get the tyvek versions. They cost a little more, but really do hold up to water, abrasion, and all sorts of trail-related abuse very well. It would be worth a visit to the AMC Pinkham Notch visitor center to see what maps they have. Get your AMC membership first, which I think gives you a discount. That was the easy part. Unlike the west and other places I\\'ve been, there are a great many smaller but still quite pretty and little used local trails. Apart from a few well known and popular areas, like the Blue Hills, Middlesex Fells, etc, there is little centralized information. Don\\'t let that fool you though, the popular areas are only the tip of the iceberg. For example, I live in Groton, which has over 100 miles of hiking trails. You can get information about them at http://www.grotontrails.org , but if I hadn\\'t told you, you\\'d probably never have found that. I am on the Trails Committee in Groton, and I like to think we do a better job than most towns around here, but all towns have some conservation land, usually with public trails. You\\'re not going to find alpine vistas here or 10 miles of trail without a road crossing, but there are more hidden gems than you might think. When you only have half a day and want to get out to nature, go explore some of the local places. In Groton alone we have a number of heron rookeries, numerous beaver ponds with dams and lodges, a few open vistas, swamps, meadows, pretty ponds, lots of little streams, upland woods, lots of eskers, quite a number of kettle holes, etc. Come check it out. You will likely be surprised how much nearby nature is hidden yet accessible. One way to find the local gems is to check out some of the AMC \"local walks\". These are great ways to get introduced to places you would have a hard time finding on your own.',\n",

       "    'body': \"As background, I've hiked the Kungsleden in 2014 (my second hike, and first self-organized), as well as both marked trails and cross country in Norway and Iceland. To add to the risks already mentioned: Do not underestimate the general, less obvious hazards in tough terrain. For example, both in Iceland and slightly off trail in Kungsleden I encountered overgrown streams. What looks like a mossy path between thick bushes (and easier to walk) might turn out to be hollowed-out gound, and stepping on it can end half a meter lower than it should have. That's something you can't really prepare for just by reading online articles, you learn from experience. If someone gets injured by something like that, a remote area without marked trails could become a serious problem - even if you have a satellite phone, describing the position while inexperienced with navigation could be hard. On a marked trail, that's a lot easier, mentioning the previous and next hut/waypoint makes you easy to find. Advantages of a marked and maintained trail: no (or easy) fording (less risks, no fording shoes necessary) hazardous terrain is mostly laid out with planks, eliminating a lot of less obvious risks navigation (even with basic map/compass skills) is easy, as well as communicating your position in case of emergency others will be around to help out if necessary - both hikers you meet on the road, and hut staff in case of bad weather (which can happen often and quickly) there are some huts to take shelter and dry your things. Hiking in wet boots for a week is not really pleasant. As you are inexperienced and have a lot of things on your mind - save yourself a lot of trouble and risks, take a marked and maintained trail for the first hike. You have less to prepare for, less that could go wrong, and there are others around who could help out. The Kungsleden is still very beautiful, there's a reason it's famous. As for how crowded the Kungsleden is (or was 2014): Make sure you don't go there when Fjäll Raven Classics happens. That's hordes of good-weather tourists going from Kebnekaise to Abisko in a short while, definitely not enjoyable. Besides that time, it's not that frequent you meet someone. We went from Abisko to Vakottavaare, and after we got south of the Kebnekaise, it got a lot quieter. Might be useful for you - someone around for the first days, in case something went wrong, then less company when you've got a hang of it. Even if that's still too crowded, take another trail, there are more choices in the region, like Padjelantaleden. But going off trail for the first hike seems reckless to me. Once you got the basics covered, you can aim for the more remote areas. As side notes: Even on Kungsleden, there was no cell phone coverage except for the Kebnekaise basecamp area. Satellite phone might be nice to make calls, but for emergencies, a Personal Locator Beacon (PLB) might be better. I'd say it's overkill for the Kungsleden (see navigation), but off-trail it should be essential. For the training hikes, include some steep ascends. By my experience, that's where boots fail first. Do it every two weeks with full weight, and your body gets used to it, that makes it a lot easier on the hike.\",\n",

You can follow it to Coconino Overlook, Supai Tunnel, or Roaring Springs in a day depending on your level of fitness (rule of thumb: hiking out takes twice as long as hiking in). For views from the canyon rim, there are various trails ranging from the half-mile Bright Angel Point trail to the ten-mile Ken Patrick trail: pick one (or more).\",\n",

When I was in University I led a group of guys on a multi-day backpacking trip in the mountains near where I grew up, I was nervous because I knew a couple of them were runners and spent a lot of time jogging each day; I doubted my fitness in comparison. On the hike it became apparent that I was the strongest hiker carrying a big bag, the reason being that out of everyone in the group, I had spent my youth carrying big bags on long hikes. The others were athletic, but had trained their bodies to perform during different activities. That being said, on another occasion when I took a group of boys out backpacking there was one 17 year old boy who had never carried a bag in his life, but was heavily involved in team sports. He stormed the trail like nothing could slow him down leaving everyone else in his dust, and did it without breaking a sweat. To add insult to injury he did it wearing an old pair of gym sneakers. If you're reasonably fit, and have a good pair of footwear, then I'd say you're adequately prepared to take that hike on. The only thing you'll need to learn is how to pace yourself. If you don't know how to pace yourself, you'll figure out your pace after about an hour of hard hiking when you're exhausted. What would serve you better than physical training, is practical knowledge. Learn some basic mountain safety and first aid. Those skills will serve you better in the mountains than how many leg days you do in a week.\",\n",

From Wiki: The trail is separated in four portions which each represent approximately one week of hiking. The most practiced part is by far the northernmost, between Abisko and Kebnekaise. The season, when the huts are open usually runs between mid-June and the end of September, rowing boats are usually at place in the end of June or beginning of July. Huts have been constructed along the trail, separated by a distance that a walker could expect to cover during the day, about 9-22 kilometres (6-14 mi). The huts are primarily operated by STF. For a small fee, it is possible to pitch a tent outside and use the facilities. Supplies can be bought in some of them (Alesjaure and Kebnekaise Fjällstation for example). Some emergency shelters can also be found on the route. While there are the official Swedish maps, the only available scale I know of is 1:100'000 - quite large for hiking maps. On the other hand this also prevents the avid trekker to carry an entire backpack full of 1:25'000 maps. Especially the northernmost section (1-2 weeks) is fairly popular, and there might be a fair demand for dedicated trail maps for this section. The guides that I own/saw personally only include very crude and essentially useless maps for tiny sections of the trail. Apart from that it is also a wonderful trail. Highly recomend it. :)\",\n",

It was spontaneous and I was fascinated, and surprised by the time it took me (mostly because all was so new and exciting, but still). From the highway driving with my car I can see that the hill I just hiked on is connected in a chain with other hills. Since I really enjoyed my first hiking trip, seeing the hill chain made the idea arise to hike along that chain for a multiple day trip. I'm used to walking for longer distances a few times, even up to like 30KM on kinda even areas, but I've never done a multiple day trip in a hilly area. My problem is, I never did something like this before and don't know anyone who did a trip like this before (or at least no one I am aware of having done it). All I could figure out myself so far that I would absolutely need to take with me would be warm clothing, a tent, a sleeping bag and of course provisions. I am planning to start on a Friday morning/noon and be back in Heidelberg in the afternoon/evening of Sunday. Now I feel quite sure that what I considered so far will be too little preparation for a 3 day trip, and probably cause me to abort my trip earlier. Also I feel like there might be dangerous situations I could be facing that I'm not aware of, and have no idea how to prepare for them yet. My question is: Doing such a trip alone, as described above, what are the mandatory items I should have with me to be able to finish my hiking trip? And what are the situations I should definitely be prepared enough to face, either because they happen often enough that it is good to know about it, or situations that are dangerous enough that it would be careless to not be prepared for it?\",\n",

The Long Trail is the first that came to my mind from your description. Don't expect accommodations anywhere along the trail, like there are in places along the AT in summer. You'll be pretty much alone, except where the trail passes near ski resorts. You'll have more options where to camp than in summer, but much less options for anything other than finding and making your own campsite. For a tamer and less wild experience, you can try some of the smaller lesser-known trails. I'm from north-central MA, so the ones I'm most familiar with are the M+M and Midstate Trails. Permission to camp may be a issue. These kind of trails cross a lot of private lands with public access rights negotiated. Those rights often do not include camping. If you look at any of these secondary trails, you probably want to secure permission for camping spots in advance. Then of course there are lots of options in the White Mountains. Some of the huts are still open in winter, usually with just a single caretaker. You won't get a meal and other accommodations like you can in summer, but you can sleep indoors. Check ahead. In this case, contact the AMC at the Pinkham Notch visitor center. There are lots of beautiful and wild trails in the White Mountains that are not part of the AT. Just get a map and look around. As one of many possible examples, you can park at Lincoln Woods, then take the Wilderness Trail to Bondcliff (my favorite spot in all the White Mountains), Bond, Guyot, the Twins, etc. Or stay in the valleys more easterly. There are many many options. Another totally different possibility is to do a few day hikes on the many local trails that are all throughout the region. These are harder to find, since there is no larger organization that lists them. For example, my town (Groton, MA) has over 110 miles of trails on over 10 square miles of land open to the public. We have more miles of trails than we do paved roads, but anyone more than a few towns away probably has no idea of that. You'll never be that far from a road or a house, but you will discover some amazingly pretty places. Overnight camping is generally not allowed without advance permission, but these kinds of trails are best done as day adventures anyway. Permission can also be arranged, but that's probably more trouble than it's worth.\",\n",

       "    'body': 'Here\\'s what I could glean from the websites of the parks you mentioned. The key thing to know here is that when describing the common type of forest in an area, tree species are listed starting with the most common species. Kluane National Park and Reserve A montane forest of white spruce, trembling aspen and balsam poplar covers much of the lower valleys and slopes. This sounds like white spruce is the most common, but I would expect a good amount of aspen and poplar mixed in. Both should give some good yellow fall color. Since the spruce bark beetle outbreak, the relative dominance of deciduous trees in the overstory has significantly increased in the southern but not the northern area of the Park. There is significantly more willow than tall regenerating spruce which could inhibit tree regeneration in the understory. As of 2015, the forest remained spruce dominated with a deciduous component within the range of natural variability. Source (scroll down to section, \"Forest composition and structure\") However, most of the mature spruce were killed by the spruce bark beetle. Deciduous trees (IE the ones that make good fall color) are now more common in the southern area of the park than they used to be. All the dead spruce trees look pretty bleak in this photo . So, consider whether you\\'ll still enjoy fall colors when they\\'re intermixed with the skeletons of a forest destroyed by an invasive species. Low-growing or stunted shrubs in the transition zone include: willow, dwarf birch, and alder, which provide protection for the smaller plants. Willows turn yellow, but the foliage can be rather thin so they don\\'t always provide a great pop of color. Dwarf birch (Betula glandulosa) looks like a winner - expect low-growing patches of reddish-orange. Alders (in this region, at least) don\\'t provide fall color - they stay green long after other trees lose their leaves. ( Source ) Wrangell-St. Elias National Park Of the hardwood trees in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park the most prominent is the Quaking Aspen (Populus tremuloides). The Paper Birch (Betula papyrifera) is not as widespread as the aspen. However, it is evident in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park. The Paper Birch species are very quick to colonize areas that have been affected by wildfire. Generally the areas following the fire will have a mixed stand of Paper Birch and Quaking Aspen. Black Spruce (Picea mariana) trees are one of the two main evergreen tree species in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park. These trees occur in the more mature stages of the Boreal forest. White Spruce (Picea glauca) trees are found throughout roadsides in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park. To summarize: expect excellent fall colors in areas that had wildfires between 10 and 75 years ago. Areas that haven\\'t burned in the past century will be dominated by spruce. I didn\\'t find any maps of fires, but that information probably exists somewhere. Call and ask the visitor\\'s center for advice. Also, based on this photo of a caribou resting in fall-colored shrubs, you can expect excellent fall color in the unforested areas as well. I can\\'t tell what species are in the photo, but interspersed through the grass are two kinds of shrubs, one a bright greenish-yellow and the other a muted red. Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve Pioneer communities can develop into dense thickets of nitrogen-fixing alder and cottonwood that enrich the soil and provide shelter for other colonizing species such as willow. Farthest away from the glaciers in time and space, the lowlands near the mouth of Glacier Bay have become cloaked in a spruce/hemlock rainforest and lush, spongy tracts of muskeg. In the surrounding mountains, thick mats of flowers and heath carpet the alpine hills and meadows. That breaks down into four vegetative communities: \"Pioneer communities\" - these have alder and cottonwood. Alder will not have good fall color, but cottonwood will. It\\'s not clear where to find these communities - I guess in areas that were recently covered by glacier. Spruce/hemlock rainforest. Both are conifers, these areas won\\'t have good fall color. These are in the lowlands near the mouth of Glacier Bay. Muskeg, or peatlands, sounds promising. Expect low-growing vegetation with good fall color (more red than yellow) interspersed with clumps of dark green conifer trees. These are also in the lowlands near the mouth of Glacier Bay. Of course peatlands are usually quite wet, so you probably want view them from a distance rather than hiking through them. Vegetation on muskegs is variable but is characterized by dense stands of sphagnum moss, herbaceous plants such as sedges, rushes, forbs, and low growing shrubs. In exposed locations and in drier areas, tall shrubs and scattered shrublike trees may be relatively abundant. Source: The Common Plants of the Muskegs of Southeast Alaska Mosses, sedges and rushes don\\'t make good fall color. Bog shrubs tend to turn some nice reds, oranges and yellows, and they hold onto their leaves longer than many deciduous trees. The plant list includes leatherleaf, blueberries, and rubus (blackberry/raspberry/dewberry), which all have good fall color. The trees are all conifers, so they will stay green. Alpine hills and meadows, which are carpeted with wildflowers heath. It also sounds like the alpine meadows have a lot of bearberry, which turns a beautiful vibrant red in the fall. Tatshenshini-Alsek Provincial Park The valley of the upper Tatshenshini is characterized by open sub-alpine forests, often with extensive poplar stands and alpine tundra. Extensive poplar stands means there will be good yellow fall color. Below the mouth of the O’Connor River, the Tatshenshini is dramatically different. ... the mixed spruce-willow-birch forest found along this stretch of the river is unique in BC. Mixture of conifer and deciduous trees means there will be some fall color mixed with darker green of the conifers. In BC, the Alsek Valley is very different from the Tatshenshini. ... The broad, braided, silt-grey flows past dense groves of paper birch, willow and aspen . Higher slopes are covered with shrubby willows and slide alder . Birch and aspen have good yellow fall color. Willows are usually less spectacular in the fall; as noted elsewhere some species of aspen stay green well into the winter.

       "    'body': \"similar to the Highlands in Scotland or Scandinavian fjell Not in Germany. Although they share some similarities at a first glance, Scotland and Scandinavia have become two quite different landscapes due to a different history of human impact. In Scotland (and other hilly areas in the British-Irish isles), well over 99% of the original forest was removed by humans (historically the British Empire needed wood and today recovery is inhibited by a powerful sheep-and-nostalgia lobby, not only in Scotland but also in England and Wales, to the degree that the barren Lake District was declared a — cultural, not natural! — World Heritage Site), and extremely little of the Caledonian Forest remains. German (and more broadly Central European) culture has historically and presently have a much higher valuation of ecology. Many areas that were cleared have been reforested. I don't think any of the German Mittelgebirge have large deforested areas of land left (with droughts, storms, and plagues, there appears to be a large risk that clear-cut areas will return in coming years, though, but the ground is different and it will not look like the uplands of the British-Irish isles). The Scandinavian mountains is very different because much it is naturally above the tree line (almost none of Scotland is above the tree line), and many areas below the tree line have either restored or recovered their mixed forests due to a (much) lower density of sheep (compared to Scotland). In Germany, you will only find tundra landscapes in the higher regions of the Bavarian Alps , but it's not like Scandinavia. The mountains are steeper and busier, the valleys are deeper and narrower, opportunities for hiking off-trail are limited or absent, and you can only sleep in official accommodation, which may not be open this summer (classical mountain hut accommodation may involve many people sleeping side by side in a single huge bed, not a good situation for slowing down the spread of a contagious disease). The vegetation in the Alps is also quite different from Scandinavia. Small pockets with moors or berries do exist in the Alps, so you may find spots that remind of Scandinavia, but I don't know the Bavarian Alps well enough to recommend any in particular. If you can tolerate forests, there are many opportunities in German Mittelgebirge such as Erzgebirge , Spessart , or Schwarzwald . They are much more densely populated than the Scandinavian mountains, and if all Germans can vacation only domestically they may get even busier than usual, as they're not famous enough to draw a large crowd of international tourists as far as I'm aware. Fortunately, the density of trails is very high so it's quite possible to hike all day without meeting people (it helps if you go mid-week, off-season, in poor weather) but you will still be close to civilisation. (If someone is in the reverse situation, located in Great Britain and seeking naturally forested hills: the only ones I've found during my time there was northern Exmoor, which I found very beautiful and reminded be of hills in Germany.)\",\n",

The tree line for broad-leafed trees is lower down, but all layers of the forest see autumn colours.

Since this is as far from the Canadian Rockies as the Scandinavian mountains from the Alps, there is no strong reason to expect similar vegetation. The Kluane National Park website does mention dwarf birches, but not how common they are. It does not mention larches. How common are fall colours in the tundra and the taiga near the treeline in Alaska and Yukon? I'm a bit skeptical of x best places lists (in particular if they declare the most spectacular fall season in the entire world , some of their photos only show evergreen trees, and their ranking methodology is undisclosed).

       "    'body': \"You touched on one thing: fires are often seasonal. Want to avoid fires in the Canadian Rockies? Come in the winter time. Want to risk smoke inhilation in the BC interior, come visit in August. Find out what the situation is in the area you are visiting, for the extent of your visit. Most parks have fire safety levels that clearly indicate whether the fire risk is low, medium or high. Find out if weather patterns have been unseasonable (drought, lake of rain the previous spring, etc.). Plan your trip for after a solid rainfall, you'll probably have a better experience overall, there will be less dust if nothing else. The best way to deal with a forest fire is to avoid it. Put distance between you and the fire. Fires can expand exponentially very quickly: This week where I live a fire that had been burning for weeks went from 90 hectares to over 400 hectares overnight . In 2001 the Mount Shark fire wen from 600 to 2,400 hectares (that's 24 square km) in 2.5 hours. So distance isn't enough, you need barriers: mountain ranges, lakes, highways, all of these can help to separate you from the fire. In regards to precautions: avoid the use of fires when the fire danger is high . If you're in the back country use a stove instead, or keep fires small and constantly monitored. Set aside water and make sure the fire is completely extinguished. Rake through ashes and add additional water, ensuring that there are no coals left. Here's 10 steps on how to put out a campfire . Get an understanding of underlying wind patterns in a region, if the wind comes from the west, then the further west you are the less likely you are to be downwind from fire. Realize that in mountain valleys prevailing winds are more likely to be superseded by the shape of the valley. On the ground, the best ways to detect fire are by sight and smell. Columns of smoke can be seen for over 50 kilometres and rise up from the geography before traversing the sky. Clouds will tend to be darker, and when obscuring the sun will cause the sun to glow orange or pink . The smell of fire can carry just as far. Don't panic if you smell or see smoke, the fire itself may be dozens of kilometres away and of no risk to you. If the smoke has particulate then you are much more at risk, as there is a higher chance of cinders which are bad for your health and can also start further fires. Cinders are a clear indication that the fire is nearby and should be cause for evacuation. To fire, wind is both a means of transportation and a source of fuel. The best route when near a fire is to remain upwind with a barrier between you and the fire in case it shifts. Moving towards water, downhill, and upwind are all options when confronted with a nearby fire. Moving into the open and away from fuel sources (forest are sources of fuel, as is brush) further improve your chances: think rocky plain, parking lot, lake, that sort of thing. If the fire has been going on for a while then going to an area that has already been burnt through offers some reprieve although there will be residual heat and increased risk of exposure. I can't speak of survival tactics when overtaken by fire, but it's worth mentioning that in the US forest-firefighters carry heat resistant shelters in the event that they are overcome by fire, however in Canada heat resitant shelters aren't used as they believe it creates a false sense of security which leads firefighters to put themselves at great risk.\",\n",

The route that goes by ridges that are with sharper slopes / drops can take you to the top exceedingly faster since the forest on such a ridge is relatively thinner as compared to the milder ascends of it.

On the other hand, such a route will allow you to run through dense forests as you should expect. I personally prefer sharper ridges when I am climbing up a mountain and a milder ridge to get down as I can simply run through on a descend (though it is not advised to run while descending). Now, if you just traversing a mountain and not actually getting on the top of it, then you may not have much of a choice.

       "    'body': \"@JamesJenkins answer is pretty good. I'll add two points based on my experience as a forester. I think the 2nd point especially will help you find the info you're looking for, which is, TLDR: Forest stand maps can be very useful for planning woodland activities, serving as a great clue about where you'll find different types of forest structures and dynamics. 1) How long it takes for forests to reach a stage in succession that feels like old growth depends on the forest type, and while ~50yrs is a decent estimate, some areas may take much longer or shorter. In some cases, no amount of time will lead the ecosystem into a similar dynamic as it originally had before human disturbance. That could be the case in the USA's west where massive trees were removed on steep slopes prone to erosion, but I'm not so familiar with those western woodlands. 2) If logging is done by an institution that needs good accounting/bookkeeping, e.g. a timber investment management organization (TIMO) or government land owner (e.g. USFS), they should have a pretty good forest management plan going forward and record of the plans and timber sales from the past, at least since they started record keeping. For gov't lands this is probably public info since it's public property. Info about forest management (including logging) would be organized by forest stands . These are essentially management units, areas mapped out based on similar species, size, age class, or other distributions. Records would show what stands were harvested when and using what silvicultural prescription , and how many million board feet (MBF) of wood was sold in different grades/quality classes. Ask the local office in charge of the lands you're interested in about forest stand maps and harvest records and see what they say. If you're not sure who manages that land, you can start at your most-local department of environment agency (e.g. NY DEC, NH DES, PA DEC) and if you're clear and polite about what you're looking for I bet they'll point you in the right direction as best they can.\",\n",

Once you are a member, you will have access to the extensive list of hikes they run. There will be a bunch in the White Mountains of NH, but also many shorter but closer local hikes in areas you\\'d probably have a hard time discovering by yourself. As for above treeline, that\\'s not so easy. There are a few smaller \"mountains\" in the area that happen to have bare tops, but that\\'s not because the climate prohibits trees. Either enough soil hasn\\'t formed on top since the glaciers (only 12k years ago) covered everything, or people cut them down and they haven\\'t grown back. Mt Monadnock in southern NH (Jaffre, not quite as far as Peterborough) is bald on top, but not because it is above \"tree line\". Going further north there are some more bare summits, like Cardigan, but again, not because of weather prohibiting trees. The highest point in MA is Mt Greylock in the NW corner, but it is forrested on top (except for the parking lot and area around some buildings). The closest areas to Boston that are truly above treeline are in the White Mountains. There is true alpine tundra on Franconia ridge and the higher parts of the Presidential Range. However, this area is more than 2 hours drive from Boston, although not that much more. There is no single answer to finding places to hike. The more well known, popular, and grandiose places are well covered by the AMC maps. The White Mountain Guide Book comes with 4(?) maps that cover the White Mountain area nicely. The AT and other well known trails are there, but also many smaller less well known but very nice trails. These are all on the AMC maps. Personally, I wouldn\\'t bother getting the guide book. You can buy the maps seperately, which is really what you want. Get the tyvek versions. They cost a little more, but really do hold up to water, abrasion, and all sorts of trail-related abuse very well. It would be worth a visit to the AMC Pinkham Notch visitor center to see what maps they have. Get your AMC membership first, which I think gives you a discount. That was the easy part. Unlike the west and other places I\\'ve been, there are a great many smaller but still quite pretty and little used local trails. Apart from a few well known and popular areas, like the Blue Hills, Middlesex Fells, etc, there is little centralized information. Don\\'t let that fool you though, the popular areas are only the tip of the iceberg. For example, I live in Groton, which has over 100 miles of hiking trails. You can get information about them at http://www.grotontrails.org , but if I hadn\\'t told you, you\\'d probably never have found that. I am on the Trails Committee in Groton, and I like to think we do a better job than most towns around here, but all towns have some conservation land, usually with public trails. You\\'re not going to find alpine vistas here or 10 miles of trail without a road crossing, but there are more hidden gems than you might think. When you only have half a day and want to get out to nature, go explore some of the local places. In Groton alone we have a number of heron rookeries, numerous beaver ponds with dams and lodges, a few open vistas, swamps, meadows, pretty ponds, lots of little streams, upland woods, lots of eskers, quite a number of kettle holes, etc. Come check it out.

The trees there usually well spaced, thunderstorms are not so common, and dead wood lays around for decades before breaking down.

The coastal range is quite wet in comparison, so you won't find open valleys with no trees. You might enjoy exploring by starting in Westwood and heading north thru the Lassen NF. You will go thru small grassy valleys surrounded by wooded hills, although nothing on the scale of Rohan. Before you get further north, walk around there a bit. Hiking thru the forest here is a different experience than in most forests. There are large Poderosa pines spread out, with usually easy walking around between them. The climate gets drier as you go north and east. Around Eagle Lake, the area is more open with fewer trees. Further north instead of east it gets drier too. However, the open valleys won't be large grasslands but more rocky plains, culminating in a totally different landscape in Craters of the Moon and the Modoc NF by the OR border. Added: One thing you can do is poke around in Google Earth to see where the flat treeless areas are. Most places now have some uploaded photographs so you can see what it looks like from eye level. For example, go to 40.580N 121.078W. That's one of the meadows I mentioned north of Westwood. It's relatively small in the scheme of things, but is otherwise what I imagine Rohan to be. It's wet enough for there to be lots of grass to support horses, like Rohan. On the other hand, take a look at 40.903N 120.738W. That's a much bigger area, and you should be able to get a feeling of hiking around in large openess. However, it's dryer than I imagine Rohan.

The altitude above which fires are prohibited is what I call continuous timber line , which is probably not an official or scientific term. It is the altitude at which woods give way to scattered small islands of trees in a sea of granite. This transition is quite abrupt. May Lake in Yosemite, for example, is surrounded by woods, but a few hundred feet above May Lake there are only small scattered islands of smallish trees. There are expanses of granite with few trees well below 9,600 feet in places in the Sierra, but these are islands of granite in a sea of trees. Only yahoos would cut branches off living trees or (shudder) cut living trees down. Park regulations call for collecting only downed wood, of which there is plenty below timber line.

Usually the mornings are clear regardless of what the weather will be in the afternoon. Then on some days, clouds start rolling in by 11:00, and you can be in serious weather by 12:00 or 13:00. On other days, it stays clear. Check the weather forecast and wait for a suitable period where thunderstorms are less likely. I haven't been to the top of Agassiz, so don't know what the micro-terrain up there looks like. Finding a place to put a tent among the rocks may be difficult. The nearby (and slightly higher) Mt Humphreys has a circle of rocks at top that you might be able to pitch a tent in. The rocks would also be a minor wind break. Keep in mind that due to this being in a Wilderness Area, re-arranging of rocks significant enough to build a windbreak may be frowned upon. You really should have a conversation with the rangers about your plans, and then listen carefully to their recommendations, if what you want to do is allowed at all.\",\n",

It takes some clear area with shade, but a little sun during the day. By hiking up old logging roads that twist and turn, you can often find them either in the road or on the side of a cut where the shade/sun mixture is just right. If the logging road is starting to have little sprouts of trees coming up, but isn't completely overgrown, you are probably on a good candidate road. Moisture is another factor, but it is easier to look for strawberries than moisture. Another place to look is in rock slides where there are marmots. I think the marmots are out eating the berries and the seeds end up in the rock slides when the marmots return to home. I have often found them with the marmots or near the marmot homes. Wild raspberries seem to do a little better where the marmots are, so don't pass those up while you are searching for the berries. Sometimes the rock slides the marmots prefer just have too much sun for the berries, I think. Seeing wild strawberries isn't easy.

The smaller they are, the harder it is to find an easy way to remove them effectively. For both of the following you will need to take a funnel to hold the filter. However, the simple answer is a coffee filter - these are single use paper filters that are designed to take the fine grounds used for filter drip coffee (common in the US and Canada, not so much elsewhere...). In this case the grounds are perhaps the size of a salt grain, which may be a lot bigger than the suspended particulates you are talking about. Coffee filters are made of paper, so are biodegradable and quite light, so good for hiking. If these are not good enough, you can get scientific filter papers that are designed to remove a range of particulates, down to the micron range (1000ths of a millimeter), depending on the grade you get. These are not pre-shaped like a coffee filter would be, but are easily folded into a suitable shape. They come in a range of diameters - get as big as you can, you don't want to be wasting your time taking hours to filter enough water for drinking.

State forests in the east are not as intensively managed, advertised, or visited as state parks. State forests are not quite wilderness in that they are usually managed based on human-defined priorities, be it sustainable timber production, wildlife, recreation, unique areas, or some combination. The wildlife and timber production areas are generally the least obviously tread by humans and the most friendly to your own activities (i.e. you can camp there, following certain rules and conditions). There are also areas designated as different degrees of wilderness such as in the Adirondack Park . You can use those designations and maps to seek out the more wild areas. It could also be worth looking up recreational stats for different areas, as some wilderness areas (e.g. Adirondack High Peaks) are far more visited than some state forest recreation areas. If in doubt, ask the local environmental agency about location recommendations and what the rules are with camping. In NY, most state forest can be camped on as long as you follow some rules and aren't in specially designated unique areas.

We usually go there once a week, but this time it had been two weeks. The cocoons were big enough to be highly visible, so I'd expect we would have noticed them before, but I can't guarantee it, so I don't know their age. They varied in size, so perhaps they weren't all built at the same time. They have curled up and killed any leaves that are inside, so they're brown. They're attached to the tree by elaborate netting. The tree has berries, and each cocoon is woven such that there are berries inside. Inside each are a lot of tiny black dots. There are also black bugs which look and walk like inchworms, though much smaller. What's living in those things, and what will they grow into? (I apologize for the poor quality pictures.

       "    'body': \"There is already a good answer to this but I'll add a slightly different perspective, especially since you noted in your question you want more general answers. For working in the forest - as in forestry, logging, land surveying - the safety guidance about wind I was taught as a professional is as follows. Sustained winds over 15 miles per hour present a hazard and you should proceed with an abundance of caution; where normally you would look up and down often for hazards and wear a hard hat, now you need to be extra diligent in those precautions and consider changing your course of work to avoid areas with weak limbs or trees likely to fall. Examples of that kind of area include coniferous forests with dead branches hanging on the tree (as with white pines or red spruces), or areas with lots of standing dead trees yet to fall. Sustained winds over 30 miles per hour are generally not safe to work in, as it is likely there will be falling debris which could be very dangerous. Course of work should change to avoid forested areas that could drop limbs and trees in high winds. I see these as rules of thumb and on the extra-cautious end of the safety spectrum. For recreational hiking, you may be inclined to take more risks. For folks working in forests every day, extra caution needs to be practiced because it's easy to get casual and overexpose yourself to life-threatening risks. It's important not to underestimate the dangers here: 15 mile per hour wind can seem fairly gentle and branches falling may not seem like a big deal, but even with a hard hat on if a falling branch hits you in the head it can easily knock you out and/or greatly hinder your ability to safely get out of the woods and back in contact with civilization, or worst case outright kill you. I've never come across specific numbers on this but I'd point out that a fairly small diameter branch (say, 4 inches) can be very heavy, and if one were to land on your head with no other person or telecommunication contact within hours walk, you could be in a life threatening situation. Is that likely to happen? No, it would be pretty unlucky, but it does happen. Again, for hiking these might be acceptable fringe risks, but for an already-dangerous day job it's worth carrying extra caution.\",\n",

Compared to a flat landscape more heat is transfered to the air immediately above the surface, and it starts flowing up. Not necessarily directly vertical, but if the soil/rock is comparably naked, it can first flow upwards along on the surface. These thermals cannot move as in a flat landscape, because in the shadows at the other side of the mountain/valley there is no sun, so the energy that drives the thermal is missing. The thermal will move to the \"most favorable\" spot. So compared to a flat landscape, you may get a more stable location of the upward current. It won\\'t stop that easily and will reach further up. Of course, if there is (primarily horizontal) wind against the face of the mountain that is forced upwards as well as @Robert wrote and this may also contribute.

Ive been fishing with fish jumping all around me in those lakes and not so much as had a bite. Fly fishers have more success because their fly leaves a shadow on the water, which can be seen from below as a dark spot in the light on the surface, and the fish recognize as food. Most all lakes in the mountains are stocked with fish, that much is true for the Canadian Rockies at least. The flour actually does more to help the fish in those lakes than it does to hinder them. In mountain lakes fish are primarily preyed upon by raptors, bears, otters, and other critters. In the turbid waters the fish are safely concealed so they can't be spotted by predators. People out here will actually dye their private ponds so the fish can't be seen to protect them from birds of prey. If they don't then the eagles and hawks will snatch all the fish out of their ponds in no time.\",\n",

At least try to stay in reasonable cell service. Large areas of the Leavenworth National Forest, Steven's Pass and much of the North Cascades are outside cell service. I guess you could have an EPIRB or a sat phone, but the help is still some time away. I grew up around the North Cascades and the thought of a green camper stepping out alone to try his new hobby in the North Cascades makes me cringe. Snoqualmie has cell phone reception nearly throughout the Sno Valley. That equals some comfort, and practicality even. You can dial in navigation, and stay in touch with loved ones/checkins. Another benefit is the area is more heavily travelled. Less bear, slightly lower likelihood of human/animal hostile encounter than say Steven's Pass. (based on current Cascade bear, wolf, cougar, and wolverine migration data) I believe the North Cascades are a bit more brutal overall, but the Snoqualmie Valley, North Bend array, and Issaquah Alps all offer plenty of getaway and challenge. Take a look at Alpine Lakes Wilderness if you need more elevation. I have been going to Otter falls each year and that is fun also. Suggested route inside the Snoqualmie Valley is: Snoqualmie Valley Trail.... to John Wayne Trail / John Wayne State Park (Near Rattlesnake Lake) overnight camping at John Wayne state Park... continue to Summit at Alpental along John Wayne Trail (AKA, Iron Horse Trail). I run this route from North Bend occasionally. Its a nice easy grade, some nice scenery, and still in cell phone reception. Ryan\",\n",

Wikipedia has a list of US Old Growth Forests these will have never been logged ( I am going to ignore selective harvesting as healthy management practice for simplicty ) As a partial answer, it is relatively easy to find one of the few areas that have never been logged. In my experience being under the canopy of a forest area that has not been logged in ~50 years is very similar to old growth. I think the key you are interested in is mapping logging in the last 50 years. This question intrigues me, so I have been looking for maps of logging, and I am not finding any. Here is a guess on why they may not exist. Road and topography are relatively stable, these maps are easy to find. Logging is much like farming, it is always occuring and transient in impact Decisions to log a specific area are complex and mostly relative to very local considerations There is not a single clearing house for the information. There might be Reforestation maps and I found some like globalforestwatch I currently live in an area with very little comerical logging so I can not speak to the accuracy of it or others.',\n",

I would advise anyone planning on heading out into the hills to read both of these excellent books - Langmuir is the book for British Mountain Leader Training, and the Mountaineers covers a lot extra information for activities over in North America. I don\\'t think being away from the treeline is particular problematic (unless you are the only thing on a very flat piece of ground). As long as you are not on the top of a ridge/hill, then there is a safe \"shadow zone\" on the side of the hill - I think something of the order of 2/3 of the way between the hilltop and its base. The only thing is - you should sit on top of a plastic sheet or your backpack to prevent picking up stray eddy currents from the ground. From Langmuir (Mountaincraft and Leadership, 3rd Edition): You can get a shadow from a 7m or taller cliff where the safe zone is between 3m from the base out to the height of the cliff - this means standing 5m from a 7m cliff should reduce your chance of a lightning strike (note - reduce - there is still a chance you can get hit, there is no 0%). There is a diagram on page 227 of 3rd Edition - I can\\'t find one to link to, unfortunately. He doesn\\'t say how steep the cliff should be, though.

Most of the roads in Rocky Mountain National Park can be traveled by ordinary passenger cars, at least when it's not snowy. The roads in the nearby national forests vary widely. The main forest roads can be traveled by ordinary passenger car, but a more capable car will give you access to more places. If you want to maximize your ability to access lots of different trailheads, particularly in the more remote parts of the National Forests, you want something with high ground clearance and all-wheel drive. I've been on many remote forest roads throughout AZ, NM, UT and CO, both with passenger cars and high ground clearance all wheel drive vehicles. There is a lot you can get to with just a passenger car. If I had to pick between high ground clearance and all-wheel drive, I'd definitely choose the high ground clearance. In pratise, one usually comes with the other though. The roughness of some of the roads is much more of a issue than getting stuck due to lack of traction. In some cases I was in a high ground clearance vehicle that had to be manually switched into all wheel drive. While I did that in a few cases, most of the time it wasn't worth the trouble and possibility of forgetting to switch back to two wheel drive when getting to a paved road. You can go a lot of places with a ordinary car if you're careful and are willing to stop, get out, look at the road, and plan your route. I've actually re-arranged rocks in a stream bed to be able to drive over it in a passenger car. Snow on the road totally changes the tradeoffs. Lots of back country roads are closed in winter instead of being maintained. Unless you have a snowmobile, you'll have to get out and ski or snowshoe them anyway. If you want to go as far as you can with a car in winter, definitely get chains and a vehicle that can do all wheel drive.

Do a search and you\\'ll see. DCR (MA Department of Conservation and Recreation) has several publications on invasives, which will include information about Oriental Bittersweet. Bittersweet likes a lot of sun, so often starts growing where there is a new opening in the canopy due to a large tree falling over, logging, or other human clearing activities. There are enough instances of this plant around, that chances are good a bird will drop a seed nearby. If this is at the edge of the woods where there is a lot of sun, the small plants grow, climb up exising trees, and eventually strangle them to death. It is unfortunately all too common at forest edges, like along the sides of highways. Next time you drive down I-495, 490, and the like, notice the green \"blanket\" covering the open side of the forest edge. Once you know what to look for, you\\'ll see this plant everywhere. For small areas, like your yard, mechanical control can be effective. The wood is soft and easy to cut with hand clippers up to maybe 1\" in diameter. Cutting at the ground kills the vine in the tree, but it doesn\\'t kill the roots. These things spread not only by seed, but also by a network of roots.

Keep cutting and pulling, and eventually the plants in that area will die. However, if there are other infestations nearby, and there probably are, birds will deposit new seeds. You have to be vigilant anyplace there is good sun. It\\'s a lot less work to pull a few new plants once a month than to deal with a widespread web of roots a couple of years later.

Altitude : is a big factor in hikes, often in the West, especially around the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevadas, you will experience a lot of altitude changes. the Western terrain varies widely - even in the space of a few miles. Make sure your equipment (boots, pack, supplies, etc.) can handle changes such as these. I've changed many thousands of feet in several hours, on foot. Be prepared for altitude sickness and realized that you burn more energy/calories at higher elevation. Also, there is less air. So you will find that you will run out of breath much quicker (depending on how extreme the elevation is). You probably will have to adjust your timetable to allow for breaks and time to adjust to the elevation and breathing in thinner air. Wildlife : The American West, again, especially in the Rockies and Sierras, as well as other mountainous/forested areas, there are a lot of different kinds of wildlife. Be aware of what each region has and how to identify and deal with them. I've written a summary of dealing with bears here: What precautions should I take to protect myself and my camp from bears? . Bear in mind, for example, that there are similarities and differences in how you should encounter a bear and a mountain lion. Mountain lions, you should stare down, bears, no. But you should make yourself as big as possible to both. Weather : Always plan for a variety of weather conditions, you can get snow, rain, and clear skies all in the space of 12-18 hours. Many Western states are desert areas, meaning it can be very hot during the day, and very cold at night. So plan accordingly. the climate is often hot and dry, the humidity can be very high or very low, so be prepared for dry skin, cracked lips, and expect to drink much more water in dryer climates than you are used to.

       "    'body': 'This isn\\'t a direct answer to the question, but I want to point out that most ordinary forest fires pose little danger to humans. It is the relatively unusual crown fires which can be very dangerous. In generally dry pine forests, like many parts of the western US, forest fire is a natural and relatively frequent (from the point of view of long-lived trees) event. Periodic fires clear out the understory and ground litter. The plants in these areas have evolved with this pattern of fires and have various strategies for dealing with it and even benefitting from it. The long lived trees have evolved means to survive such fires. Mechanisms include thick and fire-resistant bark, and shedding low limbs as the tree grows. If a area is swept by such a fire periodically, then the down and dead fuel is periodically removed and the nutrients locked up in them returned to the soil. True crown fires are a different story. They are very destructive but also relatively unusual. We hear about them way out of proportion to the fraction of fires they represent. This is probably because a ordinary forest fire that stays on the ground and clears out the litter is not news-worthy. In a crown fire, enough fuel is burned on the ground in a concentrated area so that heat builds up much more than normal. This then causes the whole canopy to catch fire, which gives it access to much more fuel, which then causes nearby whole trees to catch fire, etc. These are the fires we hear about on the news and that blacken and kill whole stands of trees. Crown fires happen when a normal fire hits a area where understory litter has built up. This is usually due to human intervention from stopping the normal understory fires. Of course these large fires do occur naturally too since fires are very spotty and some area may not get a small fire for 100 years just due to chance. Human activity has greatly accellerated that chance. Here is what a ordinary understory fire looks like: I came accross this fire on the south flank of Eagle Peak in Western NM on 2 Aug 2009, although I doubt it made any more than the local news, if that. The fire was slowly spreading by smoldering thru the leaf litter on the forest floor. When it hit a dry and down log, it would flare up a bit locally, then die down again as the log was exhausted. This picture is a good representation of how spotty fires are. You can see from the darkened forest floor where the fire had been and how various patches were skipped for whatever reasons. Note also how the older trees, ponderosa pines in this case, are basically unscathed, even if growing in the middle of one of the burnt patches. Even a few of the small trees in the burnt patches seem to have survived. The smoke is coming from where the smoldering leaf litter reached a few down logs, which then caught fire with real flames. However, the few logs in this location aren\\'t enough to cause a raging fire. They will slowly be burnt to ash over the next day or so, with the fire front meanwhile moving on. You can see a horizontal white streak at the center of the left edge of the picture. That was a log that had already been completely burnt, with the only thing left being the streak of lighter-colored ash. I could easily and safely walk all around this fire. Here is a stump that is burning rapidly enough to show flames: Note that most everything around it has already been burnt, so this stump will burn to ash and then the fire will be over in that specific location. As you can see, I could walk right up to this without being in any danger. I did discover one danger from this fire that I wasn\\'t previously aware of. Stumps like the one in the second picture eventually burn underground for a little ways too. Most of the material then gets removed as combustion gasses, so almost nothing is holding the ground up where the stump used to be. I accidentally stepped on one of these and sank in up to my knee. It was easy enough to get out, but if the fire had been at that stump more recently I could possibly have gotten burnt on my leg. Fortunately it was only \"hot\", and a few seconds in the hole before I could pull my leg out did no damage and was not long enough to hurt.',\n",

       "    'body': \"Here in California, our mountains influence our weather in a particular way. We have a Mediterranean climate and big mountain ranges inland. Storms build up out on the Pacific, and they blow in toward the land. Often they hold their moisture until they get to the mountains, at which point they dump it. For this reason, the seaward sides of our mountains tend to be wetter. This would be the western side of the Sierra and the southern side of the Transverse Ranges. On the opposite side (east side of the Sierra, north side of the Transverse Ranges), we have more desert-like conditions, and the desert stretches on until you get to the Rockies. You can often see this quite spectacularly from peaks in the Transverse Ranges like the summit of Mt Baldy (San Antonio) and San Jacinto Peak: on one side is desert, on the other forests and cities. If you look at the vegetation, you also see a slope effect. South-facing slopes get blasted with sun and tend to be brown and dry, while north-facing slopes don't get as much sun and stay greener. The slope effect is more localized than the precipitation pattern. You can often see alternating green and brown tiger stripes in the mountains. Besides the Sierra and the Transverse Ranges, the other huge peak in California is Shasta, which is an isolated volcano cone. It does have a reputation for making its own weather, and it's said to be a bad idea to go up when there's a lenticular cloud around the summit. A physics colleague who has a background meteorology described this to me in the following way (to the best of my understanding, since he was dumbing it down for me). These lenticular clouds tend to hover around the summits of mountains. What's actually happening is that the air is not standing still. Air is flowing up and over the summit. As it rises, water droplets condense and form a visible cloud. Then as the air flows down the other side of the mountain, the droplets evaporate again and become invisible. So although the cloud stands still, the population of water droplets in it is actually constantly being depleted on one side and replaced by new ones flowing in on the other side. You may get some similar phenomena on other big, isolated peaks in Mediterranean zones, e.g., Popocatepetl/Iztaccihuatl and Kilimanjaro. However, the rain patterns are different. Mexico's dry season is California's wet season. Kilimanjaro and Mt. Kenya tend to get rain every afternoon, like clockwork, and this pattern is superimposed on the dry and wet seasons.\",\n",

       "    'body': 'Case study: Persimmon Pass. We were running a group with 20 kids and 4 adults in Willmore Wilderness in September. The nature of the trails in Willmore: At low elevations they are the remains of what used to be logging roads. Up to timberline, trails are traveled mostly by horse outfitters, and are well worn. In meadows they may scatter in multiple paths. Above timberline trails are vague. There is no signage. No bridges on creeks. The ascent of Persimmon pass took longer than expected. This is not a regularly used pass, so the trail above tree line was non-existent. It is not difficult terrain, but is largely scree stabilized with various alpine plants. We topped the pass at about 5 p.m. Sunset is at 7:30 The weather had been sun and cloud mixed. At the top of the pass we could see a small storm coming down the Rock Creek valley.(major creek defining the SW side of the Persimmon Range) I guessed 30 to 45 minutes to it\\'s arrival. One of the staff with seniority over me wanted to cut straight down the other side, to get down. I persuaded him that if it\\'s sliding scree at this slope, then further down where the gradient was steeper would mean that there were intermittent cliffs even if they didn\\'t show on the map. (A 50 meter contour interval hides a lot...) I knew from a previous similar trip that angling SE while descending would get us to a packed grass slope down to tree line. Of the group, I was the only one who had done this route segment. I also knew that the senior staff would override my decision if he was worried about being caught above tree line in a storm. My strategy was to keep the line of people as long as possible to have plausible deniability if he tried to stop us then go straight down. Above tree line, visibility was good. Keeping several hundred meters between front and back was easy to do and verify that we hadn\\'t lost anyone. Senior guy was staying with 2nd staff member that was having a tough day. That staff member was not nimble, and was having serious difficulty with the scree. And I lost them when they were in a dip. We reached the top of the grass slope as the snow hit. Visibility dropped to 100 meters. I sent the remaining staff member down with a group of larger junior boys to find a spot to camp. I divided up boys as they came in into groups and sent each with a senior boy to reach the camp below. The two staff never showed up. As expected the storm was small. Snow lasted about 15 minutes, then we could see again. Wasn\\'t enough even to stick except in a few places of thick dry moss. We had a whistle protocol: Two short blasts: \"Where are you\" One short blast \"Here\" Two long blasts \"Come to me\" Two short blasts in return, \"Coming\" Three long blasts, \"I need help\" I sent a senior boy to go away from the camp where camp noise wouldn\\'t distract, and once a minute blow two long blasts, then spend the rest of the minute listening. They came in about half an hour later. In the snow they hadn\\'t descended fast enough, and had overshot our location, coming down the next water course. That had gotten them perched above a 12 foot cliff, which they had backtrack up and around. We reexamined our mountain protocols from this incident: Arriving at the top of the pass that late forced a bunch of later decisions. Making decisions at 8,000 feet is much like making decisions after two beer. No longer at your best. Rule: Establish a turn around time that allows for a return to a viable campsite at least an hour before sunset. If the go/nogo time arrives, and you aren\\'t at the pass, you turn around and go back to a usable camp. If the other side of the pass appears on the map to be no more difficult, then you must get to the pass before go/nogo time. If the far side looks more difficult then the go/nogo time needs to be adjusted. But this time MUST be set at the start of the day when judgement is at it\\'s peak. Rule: Establish rendezvous points at various locations. These should be spots that are easy to spot, and as unambiguoius as possible. Examples: Intersection of trail and timberline, shoulder of ridge, major stream crossing, trail junction. Rule: In case of separation, main group builds a visible fire at first opportunity. Rule: Ensure that all your leaders know the overall plan for the day. Training recommendation: When training new staff use the existing situation, run a couple of changes (different weather, different time, different ability) and game out the scenario, getting them to think and speak about it. Training recommendation: Involve all staff and interested senior boys in the discussion setting up the go/nogo times. Previous existing protocols: whistle protocol above. (Everyone has a whistle) Buddy system. No one travels alone. Staff sweep. Last person is a staff member. By preference the tail end group has 3 people in it. Multiple copies of the map. Our rules say 2 copies by 2 people, with one copy with the sweep. In practice we usually ran with 3 copies, and if senior boys were interested, they also had copies. Usually this boiled down to the trip leader, the navigator, and a newish staff member learning to navigate. Anyone who had a map, also had a compass.',\n",

Your level exposure while climbing is determined by how unprotected your climb is, which is summed up by how likely you are to sustain injury if you took a fall. On vertical climbs, the availability of anchors or placements for trad gear, and the availability of good holds constitutes protection; the lack thereof determines exposure. On hikes, the steepness of the slope, and ground cover determine exposure. You\\'re much less likely to go tumbling to the bottom of a slide covered in thick willows than you are on a barren talus slope. The willows can stop and even cushion your fall, whereas you can cartwheel all the way to the bottom of a steep talus slope. The term is not exclusive to falling. Mountain exposure encompasses exposing yourself to the elements as well. Wind, weather, temperature, the sun; there are many levels of exposure. When hiking or climbing in good weather however, your level of risk of sustaining a serious injury or dying in the event of a fall is what constitutes your level of exposure.',\n",

It's actually a lot of fun to do, but it isn't for the faint of heart, or those who sleepwalk. Getting up high among the branches lets you hang all sorts of stuff and have an arboreal campsite, it's especially good to use where you have concerns about the ground...swampy areas, gators, snakes, rabid coyotes, meth addicts stumbling around in the woods. If you hang your gear away from your hammock and haven't cooked and eaten right underneath, you should be fine. And yes, bears can climb trees. They aren't ninjas though, and if you aren't awakened by the sound of them clawing their way up a tree a few feet away, you might as well sleep on the ground and not worry anyway. If one does go through the trouble of climbing a tree after you wake up and start yelling at it and shine a light on it, you still have recourse to a sidearm or using a pre-placed bailout rope to swing away like Tarzan. Makes for awesome selfies too. I usually prefer tarp/fly shelters and sleeping on the ground, and have done plenty of that while hunting in bear country. In bear country just try to give yourself a protected space...like setting up in blowdowns with trees/logs piled on three sides. And then you have built in alert/protection (noise to climb over, barrier) in three directions and one approach to worry about. Pile brush to narrow it, and build your fire there. People have used that technique for millennia. Really, don't worry. Just sleep with your pistol and knife. All smart bear tacos are armed tacos.\",\n",

Both are implicit in your question, forest succession defining new forest converting to mature forest and management goals define what's desirable. If the goal is to have arable land, room to settle (build and live) on, and room to keep livstock, then early succession forest or rather grassland is much preferable to mature forest. This is because early succession stages of forest tend to be more palletable to livestock and are far easier to plow or deforest if need be. As for more desirable to recreation, that depends on the kind of recreation one hopes for. You and many others appreciate being in a mature forest as a pinnacle of experiencing the outdoors, but in areas known for their picturesque rolling grasslands and roaming herds of livestock, earlier stages of the ecosystem's succession may be much more desirable. Lastly, note the difference between wilderness versus land managed with varying degrees of intensity. Grazing is one management regime, and it is probably a historic/long-term one, so it may be kept out of tradition and its benefits the area has come to enjoy. The combination of livestock and forestry is called silvopasture , which is an an ancient form of agroforestry. Silvopasture can have significant benefits for agro-ecosystems and farmers' businesses. Managing stages of succession is a key component of many agroforestry systems, and so here we may simply see a case of land managers preferring to keep their agro-ecosystem at earlier stages of succession, allowing them to continue enjoying the uses of land best suited to those earlier stages.\",\n",

On such a map, plot the position of your viewpoint (obtained by GPS), and from there, the bearing of the tree - not forgetting to account for magnetic deviation. Limbs of hills along this line exist where the contours run parallel to the bearing line; your tree will be near one of those spots.

       "    'body': 'No, a \"national forest\" here in the US is a legal designation and does not mean the land is actually covered with trees (a forest). In the US, there are quite a number of governmental divisions that own and manage land that is open to the public to various degrees. Sticking just to the larger federal ones, there is BLM land (Bureau of Land Management), department of the interior which runs the national parks and monuments, the department of agriculture which runs the national forests, and a few more I don\\'t remember details of. For example, I don\\'t remember who exactly is responsible for national wildlife refuges, but is that yet another agency (within DoI, I think). Some other agencies have land that is partly open to the public in some cases more as a aside, like the military. Generally military reservations are not open, but there are some strange deals like the Kofa National Wildlife refuge in AZ that is was actually carved out of the Yuma Proving Grounds, with a deal that the military can take it over again at any time in case of national need. It might require only a presidential edict or possibly even less, versus the act of congress it would take to otherwise move land around between agencies. Each of these agencies is tasked with different objectives, so they therefore run their lands differently. National parks and monuments (the only difference between the two is that a park is established by congress and a monument by presidential edict, which is sometimes then ratified by congress and converted to a park) are run by the Department of the Interior and are primarily for conservation with some mandate for public access, recreation, and education. National forests on the other hand are run by the Department of Agriculture, and quite a variety of benefits are expected from them, many of them conflicting. The national forests are looked at more as nationally owned resources. The DoA likes to refer to them as \"land of many uses\", which you often see on the road signs. Much of the nation\\'s timber harvest comes from the National Forests. Sections are routinely auctioned for harvest. The forest service must plan these on a long term sustainable basis, but providing forest products is a primary job of a National Forest. More broadly, National Forests are really lands held as a public resource. The name came from when these were first established as the federal government bought up lands the timber companies clear cut and dumped, so they were originally forests. Since then, the same governmental infrastructure was used to hold other public lands regardless of vegetation cover. The common theme to all National Forests is land held as a public resource, not necessarily just conservation, although there is a mandate that any uses be long term sustainable. The National Forests do include a lot of true forest, but also tundra, desert, and various other landscape types. But wait, then there are the federal Wildernesses. These are well explained in a answer by LBell . The Wilderness designation runs accross agencies. Any federal agency that holds land can have a wilderness area on that land if it meets the various criteria. There are Wilderness areas in National Parks and Monuments, in National Forests, and on BLM land. These are basically pure conservation areas, and are even more protected than just a National Park. Here are some examples: This is in the White Mountain National Forest in NH looking south from Zealand Notch in the fall. This area really is a forest, as with most of the eastern US when the land is left to its own. This is in the same \"Forest\", but this section is above tree line. To the right of the ridge is the Pemigawasset Wilderness, which is a region within the White Mountain National Forest. Here is land in a totally different climate with totally different plant cover. This is in the Tonto National Forest of AZ north of Phoenix. Here the name \"Forest\" is purely the legal designation.',\n",

It\\'s viewed as a national resource, although it generally has to be used in a sustainable way. Various people\\'s and organization\\'s view of \"sustainable\" differ, however, so some serious controversies can erupt. Keep in mind that the Forest Service is part of the Department of Agriculture. You often see the slogan \"Land of many uses\" on signs as you enter and leave Forest Service land. While preservation can be a primary goal of some areas, others are managed for timber, for example. Hunting is also usually allowed, within state and local restrictions, of course. Most of the nation\\'s forest products come from National Forest lands. When the forest managers decide some area is ready to be harvested, they specify exactly what is allowed to be done where, and put it out for bid. So to answer your question more directly, you as someone hiking around might notice: Timber harvesting in progress. Hunting. More back country motorized vehicle use. Fewer facilities like vistor centers and interpretive programs for educating the public about the area and its nature. Fewer restrictions on where you are allowed to go and where you are allowed to camp. That all said, there is another designation, called a Wilderness Area 1 , that can exist within just about any kind of federal land. These places are strictly reserved for nature where \"the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain\" .

There\\'s really not much else you need to be concerned about in a well forested area except for critters, which everyone knows Australia has in abundance - all sorts of little deadly creatures that could easily kill you in your sleep with a single bite, but I digress. The Great Dividing Range looks awesome, and rich with natural shelter: I\\'m from BC , camping in the trees is always preferable to sleeping in an exposed area, trees provide natural shelter from the elements, they typically have softer ground around them, and make tying down your fly super convenient (tie lines to the trees instead of sticking pegs in the ground. I was camping this summer in the Ptolomy Plateau just below the treeline when it started to pour rain. We were in a nice patch of big trees that kept the rain off nicely. We discovered that the area we picked to pitch our tents was apparently a popular shelter for the local wildlife too, as deer kept running out of the bushes to our spot to try and escape the downpour. They didn\\'t seem too impressed when they discovered that their spot had already been taken. The first thing I do when I find a nice flat area large enough for my tent is to take a look around and see which way the the ground slopes around it. You don\\'t want to set your tent up in a spot were you think water might flow towards you, you want water to flow away from your tent. Sometimes I\\'ll even dig a little \"moat\" around my tent with a stick or trowel to help the water flow around it in case I can\\'t find a perfect spot that\\'s guaranteed to stay dry. The next thing I check is which way I want my head to point. I actually lay down on the ground and get a feel for which way is \"head up\". If there\\'s even the slightest bit of a grade it will affect your comfort, so you want to orient you tent so your head is uphill, and your feet downhill. Of course you also want to check to make sure that there aren\\'t any big rocks or roots that are going to poke you in the back while you sleep. In especially soggy areas, people will set their tents up on gravel or scree beds. Small scree is easy to work with because you can rake it around with your hands to make a flat spot, and you don\\'t have to worry about water as much because it will actually flow right under your tent through the scree.',\n",

To partially address the forest service will often have controlled burns , but it is not always sufficient, and larger fires will occur Wilderness managers need a way to quantify and monitor the effects of suppressing lightning-caused wildfires, which can alter natural fire regimes, vegetation, and habitat. Using computerized models of fire spread, weather, and fuels, it is now possible to quantify many of the hidden consequences of fire suppression. Case study watersheds in Yosemite and Sequoia–Kings Canyon National Parks were used to simulate where fires might have spread if they had not been suppressed, and what effects those fires would have had on fuels.

In the option 1 you described, you would be activating your PLB, then waiting for rescue above the treeline. Fire doesn't go very far above treeline, but smoke, ash, embers and heat do. Just because you're above the treeline doesn't mean you're guaranteed to be safe from the fire, you just won't likely get burned to death, but death by flames isn't the only way to die in a forest fire. When the Kenow wildfire burned 38,000 hectares of forest last summer, the ash from the fire was piling up in my back yard 50km away. Air quality was so bad that we had to stay indoors with all the windows closed, and the sun was blotted out for weeks. If you are on a mountain directly above a blazing forest fire, your odds of dying from smoke inhalation are pretty good, but breathing in a hot breath of superheated air is what usually kills people trapped by fire. The situation you described is the exact reason why parks require people to buy backcountry permits to go backcountry camping. Park staff need to have a record of how many people are deep in the backcountry, so they know in a situation like a forest fire how many people they need to evacuate. If you're going to a spot where they don't require permits, then make sure someone knows where you are, or at the very least leave a note on your vehicle indicating where you have gone and when you expect to return. If you are in the backcountry and discover a fire, you must report it immediately , especially if you are above the fire and it has you cut off from your escape route. You're best chance of surviving a fire is to reatreat! If you are on top of a mountain, this means getting off the mountain . Do not hang out on the rock and expect you're going to be safe, you need to get off that mountain as fast as you can, if you know of an alternate route, take it. Rations are the least of your concerns when running from a wildfire. You can survive days without food and water, but you will not survive breathing in unrelenting plumes of smoke or superheated air. (One caution with descending a mountain is to choose your route wisely; if you get ledged-out on the decent you can get yourself in just about as much trouble as being stuck in the path of a fire.) In any case, your first course of action should be to call for help, if you have no means of contacting Emergency Crews, and no way to evade the fire, then use your PLB. Rescue crews will want to know that you are out there. The problem with using your PLB is that once you deploy it you typically need to hang around in one spot in order for rescue crews to find you. If you're in the smoke however, it's unlikely they will ever find you, so deploying it is not going to help you get found unless you can get out of the smoke to somewhere open and visible.\",\n",

A person can easily stumble into these holes or have the earth give way above a burned-out root system . Immediately following a fire, these pockets may still be hot and pose a burn risk. The fire may have consumed a significant portion of a tree’s root system or lower trunk, although the tree is frequently left standing. These trees may fall at any time, even without wind. Fallen trees may get hung up in the branches of other trees and break away at a later time. Upper portions of the trunk and branches may have been partially consumed in the fire, yet still retain a fragile connection to the tree. Again, these may break away from the main tree without warning. Wind will exacerbate the problem. For how long it would take to have all of the fire burned trees fall, it could take decades. However, the risk should lessen as time goes on.\",\n",

Growing up I was actively involved in scouting, and every year we participated in a fund raising program known as Trees for Canada, now known as Scoutrees . We would plant thousands of new trees in a day in clear cuts where timber had been recently harvested, or on spoil piles in the mines (where they pile the mountains back up after sifting the coal out). There are people who make money planting trees for reclamation companies–mines and forestry companies are required to reclaim sites, so they employ people to do so–but they get paid per tree, so they plant as fast as they can to reach a daily quota. I was told by the environmental specialist on the last scoutrees fundraiser I participated in that they love when the scouts plant, because the trees they plant have a higher survival rate. Volunteer driven reclamation projects are more successful because the people are driven by service and put more care into the work. So in my opinion, the best way to give back to the mountains, is to volunteer with groups who do reclamation work, or donate to such groups, you can donate directly to Scoutrees for example. Another good organization to donate to would be the Nature Conservancy . They own a tonne of land around the world, including some land surrounding Glacier/Wateron National Park where I live.

You've got intermountain, continental, and maritime avalanche climates all with their own habits and characteristics. There are so many variables at play here that Bruce was able to write an entire book about it. Avalanches tend to occur at a specific slope angle in each climate, and that angle can be very different from each other climate, but trees and rocks probably tend to exist in the same type of terrain. Taking all of that into consideration, what seems to be going on here is that the avalanche terrain in Canada that lures back-country snow-goers must contain slopes that allow for more rocks and trees. There are several types of avalanches in that book that aren't necessarily powerful enough to easily bury you, but still powerful enough to sweep you into a tree. Combine those types of avalanches with slopes rich in trees, and you've got the recipe for the blunt force trauma. Europe, on the other hand, could very well have mostly terrain that either doesn't promote as many trees and rocks, or does promote larger avalanches that are more likely to bury the victims.\",\n",

       "    'body': \"You don't say anything about the climate and ascent/descent involved, but assuming an average mountain trail 160 miles (260 km) should be doable in a single push. I don't think there's any magic solution to this - it's simply applied common-sense. The main issue is the extra food you have to carry without resupply - around 1kilo/2.2lbs per day on trail plus a bit extra for safety. First, get fit so you can cover the ground fast First and foremost, I would suggest you get well trained before you go. This means you can travel fast and carry less food, keeping your pack-weight more reasonable. Get going at first light and walk steadily till dusk. Start slow and finish strong, keeping plenty of energy in hand. Strong walkers would aim to average well over 20 miles (32 km) a day on mountain trails in summer conditions - this is a typical pace for anyone tackling trails like the AT or the PCT so it's doable if you're trained. Even if you only manage 20 miles (32 km) a day, you should cover 160 miles (260 km) in a maximum of 8 days. Fast walkers would complete a trip like this in 5-6 days. If the weather in your area is volatile, you need to allow an extra day or two in case you get storm-bound. Second, minimise your base weight If you want to cover distance, you'll probably want to prioritise lightness over comfort. So you should reduce your base pack weight as far as your skill and experience allows without compromising safety. For example, if conditions allow you might want to take a tarp rather than a tent. Third, pack calorie-dense food Then you'll want to pack calorie-dense food with a high fat content. It's reasonable to aim for an average of around 120 calories per oz (18 MJ/kg), or even higher if you're prepared to eat a lot of fats such as peanut butter or olive oil. As an average sized male carrying a pack all day on a steep trail you'll be burning around 4000-5000 calories (17-21 MJ) daily. To maintain your weight, you'd have to carry 5000/120 = 42 oz (1.2 kg) of food per day. Most people feel this is too much, and carry around 2.2 lbs (1.0 kg) of food per day (or less if they're small and light). On long trails they re-feed in the trail towns to maintain their weight. On a relatively short walk like this, you would lose a little body-fat. If you have body-fat to spare, you could safely under-eat by an additional 500-1000 calories (2.1–4.2 MJ) a day, so you'd lose a few lbs from your belly during your walk, reducing your pack weight by a few lbs. It's important to trial this on day-walks or weekenders before committing to a bigger walk, so you know how much food you need to keep you happy on the trail.\",\n",

       "    'body': \"It's hard to be absolutely certain without a specific goal for the firewood, but there are some generic things to look for: Sap: Sap-rich woods usually produce a lot of smoke, often black or dark grey in color due to incomplete combustion of the terpenoids in the sap. Classic examples include cedar and pine. Dried twigs from sap-rich woods can make good tinder if prepared properly to increase surface area, and the twigs can make OK (but not great) kindling, but large fires made of sap-rich woods are generally bad for cooking and also bad for your health (the combustion byproducts aren't generally toxic, but the particulates can cause long-term respiratory issues like COPD if you breath in lots). The smoke from some such woods can be very effective at keeping insects away though. Density: The denser a wood is, the harder it is to start, but the hotter and slower it will burn. Oak, apple, and cherry are all good examples of woods that burn long and hot, they make good fuel, but are sub-par for kindling and essentially unusable for tinder unless completely dry and started with a something like a magnesium fire starter. Especially dense woods that don't float are a special case here, they're often extremely difficult to start even with a fire that's burning well. Water: Wet wood burns with lots of white 'smoke' which is actually steam. New growth often is wet enough to burn like this too. If you can't find dry (seasoned) wood, start a fire using whatever the least wet wood you can find is, and use it to dry out other wood to use as fuel. Heartwood versus sapwood: Some species of tree have a marked difference between the inner and outer wood, usually showing as a difference in colors. In such trees, the heartwood (the inner wood) burns a bit differently from the sapwood (the outer wood), but the difference is often not enough to matter for most purposes. Things that look like wood but aren't: Bamboo is the easiest example, with palms being another. These aren't technically wood, and they generally don't burn very well, often producing a lot of smoke (just like grass does), but they can be hard to tell from actual wood. They do still burn though, so if you can find lots of bamboo for some reason, don't hesitate to use it. There's also some more specific advice I can give: Certain trees should just be avoided because burning them is a safety hazard. A classic example of this is eucalyptus. The oil in the eucalyptus trees that gives them their distinctive smell has an insanely low autoignition temperature, and may cause eucalyptus logs to literally explode when burned. Avoid burning woody plants that aren't obviously trees unless you can reliably identify them and know it's safe to do so. There are a number of plants that when burned produce exceedingly dangerous smoke. Various toxicodendron species (commonly called poison ivy in the US) are a good example of this, the oil they produce that causes dermatitis on contact with human skin can survive the rest of the plant burning and end up in the smoke, which can make inhaling the smoke lethal. Always check your wood for plants or fungus growing on it, and don't burn it if you find any. Some fungi will release spores when heated (and the spores can be toxic), and some plants contain toxins that can survive burning and end up in the smoke (for the same reasons mentioned above about burning other plants). Other growth like this also impacts how the wood itself burns, usually resulting in inferior fuel wood.\",\n",

       "    'body': \"I'll answer this from a perspective of what we follow in some of the areca nut and coconut farms that I've grown up in. The areca nut and coconut trees shed their branches often. These are similar to the dead wood that you are speaking of in the woods. These too are a nuisance when it comes to walking around. So what we do is to move these to the base of the trees instead of them being scattered everywhere. Two reasons why we do this: The dead branches help to retain moisture in the soil around the base of the trees (they act as a cover, holding back the moisture from soil). These eventually turn into fertilisers for the trees. For the dead woods, this would be similar. To add to it, each trunk of a dead tree you come across might be hosting its own mini biosphere. The insects feeding the dead trunks/branches would be feeding the birds. Which in turn might be prey for the larger prey animals. Having said that, these changes are really difficult to observe. Even for a scientist, unless she/he carries out an extensive survey, they might not notice the subtle changes that are the results of the removal of dead/decaying trees. The effects might be seen many years later or they might not be seen at all (the ecological balance might get restored due to some other factor for all you know!) So in short, removing the dead branches/trunks from the forest might not be a great idea. Instead displace them from your trails (need not be to the base of the trees as some trees might suffer due to excessive moisture). Move them around rather than removing them completely.\",\n",

It\\'s not clear if you want to or need to do a out and back, or if you can spot a car and do a traverse. Here are just a few options that come to mind without looking things up on a map: From the end of Sawyer River Road in Crawford Notch, hike up Carrigain one day, stay the night, and back down the next. There can be some good views, although I don\\'t remember now if the old fire tower on top has been taken down or not. There are great views from there if it\\'s still there. This is fairly easy for the alloted time. You can arrive in afternoon on the first day without it causing a problem. I don\\'t know about waterfalls, but there will be some stream crossings before you get onto Signal Ridge. Take the Ethan Pond Trail from Crawford Notch to Thoreau Falls. From there you can go down by the falls, south, then west, then north again over Bondcliff, Bond, Guyot, Zealand, past Zealand Falls Hut, and back to Crawford Notch. This is quite ambitious, but doable if you start early in the morning and are in good shape and willing to do a lot of hiking for the alloted time. You\\'d probably spend the night partway up Bondcliff. The upside is you go by several falls, and the top of Bondcliff is probably the most spectacular place to stand in the White Mountains. I screwed up once and ended up spending the night on Bondcliff. I don\\'t recommend that. Plan better than I did. If this still isn\\'t enough of a challenge, you take the Zeacliff trail \"shortcut\" down from Zealand Mt instead of going by the hut. I did that once too, and decided it should be a up-only trail, so I also don\\'t recommend that. Go to some of the waterfalls on the west side of Crawford Notch, but keep going instead of back to the parking lot like everyone else. There are ways to loop around and come out a different place in Crawford Notch. There should be at least a couple of choices here you can find by studying a map. I don\\'t have one in front of me, so can\\'t say much more about this off the top of my head. There are various options for one-night backpacks in the Carter-Moriah range east of Pinkham Notch. For example, start going up the Nineteen Mile Brook Trail, then pick a way that loops back to the road eventually. There should be three basic choices, with the southern one including Carter Dome. There are lots more possibilities. Get a map and look. However, one thing you probably don\\'t want to do is Franconia Ridge. There are some pretty waterfalls on the Falling Waters trail, but there are no good places to camp on top. Either it\\'s above tree line or within a exclusion zone, pretty much all the way from Liberty to Garfield. This is also the most crowded backcountry area in the White Mountains because of the number of trails providing access from Franconia Notch, and the presence of Greenleaf Hut. If you\\'re looking for a ambitious but certainly doable day hike, then this works better. One possibility is up Falling Waters, north along the ridge over Lincoln, to LaFayette, down to the hut, and back to the same parking lot via the Bridle Path. You get great views for quite a ways along Franconia Ridge, which is above treeline from Haystack to just above the hut on this route. If you do this, bring winter clothes in your pack. You won\\'t need crampons in the summer, but a good rain/wind shell, wind pants, extra wool sweater to put under the rain shell, goggles, and gloves is NOT overdoing it. The weather can change there very quickly on short notice. I\\'ve started out in shorts and a T shirt from Liberty Springs in the morning, and was wearing full winter gear except for crampons by the time I got to LaFayette. At that time 20 mile/hour sleet was blowing in my face, and I was very glad to have goggles on. This was in August.

When I was in University I led a group of guys on a multi-day backpacking trip in the mountains near where I grew up, I was nervous because I knew a couple of them were runners and spent a lot of time jogging each day; I doubted my fitness in comparison. On the hike it became apparent that I was the strongest hiker carrying a big bag, the reason being that out of everyone in the group, I had spent my youth carrying big bags on long hikes. The others were athletic, but had trained their bodies to perform during different activities. That being said, on another occasion when I took a group of boys out backpacking there was one 17 year old boy who had never carried a bag in his life, but was heavily involved in team sports. He stormed the trail like nothing could slow him down leaving everyone else in his dust, and did it without breaking a sweat. To add insult to injury he did it wearing an old pair of gym sneakers. If you're reasonably fit, and have a good pair of footwear, then I'd say you're adequately prepared to take that hike on. The only thing you'll need to learn is how to pace yourself. If you don't know how to pace yourself, you'll figure out your pace after about an hour of hard hiking when you're exhausted.

Maybe some on the side towards Arosa, but I have not been there enough to know it for sure. The lifts mentioned above are gondolas, i.e. it is quite easy to enter and exit them Depending on where you want to go, it is quite safe, or not so safe. For example taking Rothorn II up to the top, and then taking one of the snowy paths down is always a stupid idea, but taking a tour around the Heidsee is safe, as far as I am concerned. Concerning clothing: I am only wearing stable trousers, such as jeans, and stable boots. Of course gloves, a (light) jacket and something warm for the head. Depending on how fast you walk, prepare to take something of if it gets too warm. Most of the trails usually are free from deep snow, but that depends on the weather. Nevertheless, also take care of the avalanche possibilities, even though the probability for them to hit the hiking trails is rather low. Finally some nice trips I would recommend: 207 Mittelberg Parpan 203 Alp Stätz 201 Heidseerunde Nevertheless I would test all of them.

Not the softest to sleep directly on however, and these have potential to rip your sleeping bag. You could use hot rocks to make a warm mattress. This isn't a bad idea but is a lot of work as you noted. Hot rocks are definitely relevant for the question of 'how to sleep comfortably on a cold night in the forest with few materials', but might not be much better than sticks for a sleeping mat. Leafs are an obvious answer, and a good one! Some ground rules I was told for leaf insulation: 2in+ for roof, 2ft+ for bedding, no holes gaps or thin spots . That might seem like overkill but as you learned from experience, you did need a lot of leafs to make this work. The leaf solution makes the other options more viable too. If you have the time, pack sticks (~1-2in diameter) side-by-side to make a bed, then cover that with leafs to soften it up. This adds extra insulation from the ground. Sometimes it feels nice too, sometimes it doesn't. With the materials you listed, I recommend using the sheet of plastic to gather leafs faster, and make a mattress with more than 2ft of leafs. Lay the sheet on the ground, weigh it down with rocks if needed, then rake leafs onto it with your arms and feet. You can then use the plastic sheet to help separate you from the wet, cold ground. Note that not all leafs are made equal: some evergreen needles would be miserable to sleep on, but the most comfortable bedding I've found in forests happens to be evergreen: white pine needles . If you can gather a bunch of small white-pine branches and stack/weave them to be a mattress (more emphasis on getting 2ft worth than how well put together it is), you will have a very soft bed. If you can add some gear, a wool blanket will go a long way as a mattress or extra insulation in any way whether wet or dry. An option to separate yourself from the ground: you could use vines, or some other means of cordage, along with some tree poles (lengths of wood ~2in diameter) to setup a bed-frame and a cordage-mattress. This will probably take a lot of time and cordage. I've never tried it, but have seen examples of it. Bushcraft-hammock-esque.\",\n",

Backpacking for one week is hard, but backpacking for six months is not just a longer hike, but a qualitatively different hike.

Your mother has an admirable goal, and I will be thrilled if you report back that she arrived at Mount Katahdin next fall -- a thru-hiker on her first try! In addition, I will repeat my comment: your mother should: (1) take a Satellite Messenger or PLB ; (2) observe bear precautions with food, but otherwise not worry about bears; (3) get at least some rudimentary medical knowledge (if she does not already); (4) arrange to talk with you and/or a friend at logical points along the way.

       "    'body': \"Great question. As you noted the guide had native knowledge of that environment which helps a lot. In my local environment (temperature / boreal forest) I'd be decently equipped to find water in a local forest that is new to me because even if the exact area is new it is not completely unfamiliar . I have a general feel of the terrain and indicators, and I have a habit of checking topogaphy maps (if not also bringing them with me) before venturing into a new area. My local environment is more like rainforest (~1m precip/yr) but what I'd look for actually overlaps a lot with the question you linked to: Finding water in the dry wilderness I'll zoom in on the two primary guides to water I'd refer to in a new area: Water loving plants and environmental indicators . This is both large scale and small scale, for water sources large and small. On large scale , certain trees and forest types have a tendency to grow in wetter areas, so if you can see these creatures in the landscape they may indicate where you can find water. In my neck of the woods, sparse patches of mainly evergreen forests and some of the following hardwood species indicate wet spots: Yellow Birch (Betula alleghaniensis), Black Birch (Betula nigra), Red Maple (Acer rubrum). As you wander riverside areas, what forest types do you see most often (forest type as in, 3 most common species in the area)? Are there any you mostly see only near wet areas? For small scale , I'm talking about specific plants that retain lots of moisture. You really need to know these plants in advance, or at least know what plants are toxic and indicators of local environmental quality so you avoid harm while exploring plants you're not sure about, and as in any case, where you get sustenance from is susceptible to environmental quality problems. In my neck of the woods I know wild grape vines can contain water and clumpy mosses can be uplifted and squeezed to drain their moisture; neither of these sources provide a lot of water, but it is good to know they're there and in areas that I see good environmental quality indicators and no bad ones (eg. no input-intensive farms nearby, various water quality indicators looking good). Topography. Water flows downhill and accumulates in valleys and depressions. You can head downhill and you will eventually find water (even if it's the ocean!) A major challenge with this is reading the larger landscape and not getting stuck in local variations of the overall landscape. For example, to actually go downhill you may have to go up for a bit, or if you just follow the closest downhill path you may end up stuck in a higher area and not going in the actually easiest direction for lower elevation. If you have or can get a general perspective of the landscape, you are much better off! Knowing the general trends of topography and where rivers span is very valuable. A topographic map and compass are precious in this case, and even if you have neither, being familiar with the overall topography is a huge asset as it tells you what general directions you can reliably go in to find important features (roads, rivers, low spots) rather than 'shooting in the dark'. If you're in the woods and have none of that familiarity, you can try to see particularly high or low areas from openings in canopy or vantage points you can find, and go from there making best guesses about topography. A major challenge in both of these cases is limited visibility due to forest thickness. In that case local topography can be hard to gauge and you really need some familiarity with overall topography trends beforehand. Otherwise you are much worse off, but still trying to use the guides already mentioned is better than wandering aimlessly in search. And of course, an ounce of preparation is worth a pound of cure . Bringing a topography map can make this process way easier, and bringing enough water can make this process unnecessary. And even if you find water, you'll sure want to have at least sufficient containers (or ability to make them) if not also purification methods available.\",\n",

So you need to learn some basic safety/rope skills. And you can find really tough routes on smaller mountains, so you just have to read tour descriptions and check the difficulty level. You need to search for a F-rated tour without going over ice (risk of crevasses). Some guide books also mark tours/routes which are solely going over rock, so this would be more the style of tour you have to search for. This is hiking on high altitudes. If you go really high (above 4000m or even 5000m), like being said, you need some time/experience to acclimate. And I guess there aren't lots of summits on these high altitudes which are technically that easy. Kilimanjaro is a good example of a big but technically easy tour. Mount Ararat might be interesting too, also in terms of history and culture.\",\n",

I would carry or wear at least one more fleece top and one pair of fleece pants. It may be easy to stay warm in the trees, but if you want or need to stop on the mountain top it will get really cold really fast. It's safer if the t-shirt is not cotton, and waterproof pants would be better than cotton pants.

The Goretex in the boots is waterproof, but it allows cold air in. Make sure the gloves are warm enough. You should be able to cover most of your head from the wind for frostbite protection. You should consider a hood, balaclava, and probably ski goggles. Bring some chemical foot and hand heaters in case you need them to prevent frostbite. Here's what I normally use in those conditions. Everybody has their own preferences; this is just an example rather than a required list. Shirt, 2 fleece layers, and a waterproof jacket with a hood.

It does note, Most cellular coverage in national parks is provided by cell sites outside the borders of each park. Such service is limited by topography and elevation.

       "    'body': 'Camping regulations vary significantly between different national forests. The only way to know what is allowed is to ask each forest you plan to visit. For example, in the White Mountain National Forest of NH, car camping is highly restricted. It is only allowed in designated areas and along a very limited few roads. The designated sites are mostly in fee-based camps where you get a parking spot, grill, flat place for the tent, trash cans and restrooms nearby, etc. There are a limited number of free spots along a mostly obscure dead-end road that are just a place to pull out. These are termed \"undeveloped\" and are strictly first-come first-served. Don\\'t show up Friday or Saturday evening during the summer or fall and expect to find a spot. Backcountry camping is allowed in the WMNF more freely, but there are restrictions, like you must be 1/4 mile from the trail, group limits in the wilderness areas, and various exclusion zones. Penalties for getting caught where you\\'re not supposed to be can be stiff. Part of the reason the WMNF has to be so restrictive is because they get a lot of visitors relative to the land area. It\\'s only 2-3 hours drive from Boston and other populated areas, and the only area for a long ways with tall enough mountains for the tops to be above tree line. There are also a lot of roads thru the area that people have to use for ordinary purposes having nothing to do with the forest. The restrictive rules are to give people access but to keep the place from getting destroyed. In my opinion, they do a pretty good job of ballancing the demands, which also include commercial ski and lumber operations. In contrast, the much larger national forests in much less densly populated areas can afford to be more liberal. The first time I visited the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest in AZ, I went to the ranger station to ask about camping regulations as my first order of business. They looked at me kindof funny and it took a while for them to comprehend the question, since you are pretty much allowed to camp anywhere and nobody ever asks them. Eventually one of them actually said \"just don\\'t camp in the middle of a road\". The combined contiguous area of the Kaibab, Coconino, Apach-Sitgreaves, Tonto, and Gila National Forests exceeds that of Massachusetts, but far fewer people live in the vicinity. The rules are lax because they can afford to be. Everyone can camp mostly where they want to and it\\'s not causing a problem, so no need to regulate. I don\\'t have experience with the forests you mention in ID. But, what I\\'m trying to point out is that you shouldn\\'t assume anything. Ask. Probably the rules will be more on the lax side considering size, remoteness, and nearby population, but unless you ask you can\\'t be sure. There will probably be some local specific restrictions that you need to know about, even if most areas are generally open. Some restrictions can also vary be season, weather, and perceived threat of fire, so can change on the fly. Again, you have to ask.',\n",

       "    'body': \"The answers you seek are not easily quantifiable - for instance, a very fit experienced hiker might walk 50+ km a day on flat, open (i.e. not brush covered) terrain, but might only do 5-10 (or less) on steep, thickly forested hills. Some people can walk more than 100 km in a day - on urban streets/race tracks, but would be unlikely to sustain this day-after-day as you might on a long hike like the GR-5. I would guess that for an average hiker (assuming some fitness and a little experience) around 20-30 km per day would be reasonable with a weekend pack (food for 2-4 days, sleeping bag, tent, clothes, water, cooker). I've personally done easily double that on marked trails in New Zealand with experience and good fitness, but also had days off-trail where I've moved less than 1 km/hr. Edited to add: A long long time ago (over 25 years) I was taught that with a weekend pack most people would walk about 4 km/h (2.5 mi/h) on flat terrain and about 300 m (1000') vertical/hour (i.e. to climb from sea-level to 1000 m (3300') altitude on an average hill would take a little over 3 hours). These numbers imply for 8 hours walking about 30 km (18 mi) on the flat or about 8 km (5 mi) climbing (that's a lot - Everest is 8848 m/5.5 mi high) According to GRfive.com , the trail is 2500 km long and takes the average walker about 3.5 months to complete. It covers a lot of different climates, from lowland plains in the Netherlands to alpine passes in the French Alps. I don't know how you would spread out the days, but I suspect that you will have to stop a few times for the weather to be right - don't attempt a high alpine pass in a snow-storm! Being Europe, you most likely will never be particularly far from a village of some sort where you can take shelter if need be. There will be on-line resources and most likely blogs/vlogs which will tell you how people did their attempts. Maps as mentioned in the comment by @TomasBy can be obtained from sporting stores, book shops, online, with GPS subscriptions, libraries etc. I have no experience on the GR5 or anywhere in Europe, but I would expect that starting in the Netherlands (northern part) and working your way south would be easiest. This is so because the Netherlands is flat -gives you time to build fitness, and because it's in the North - colder, wetter, shorter summer. Conversely, the southern part in France is alpine - you don't want snow on the ground as an inexperienced hiker, or any risk of avalanche. You also want a longer window of time for conditions to be right to cross alpine areas - longer summer gives you this. In addition, jumping straight into the alpine parts with no fitness will be very challenging. For training, I would start by walking. Go out 2-3 evenings a week for a walk. Build up to 1-2 hours if you can. On weekends, go for a longer walk. Build this walk up to several hours (take appropriate food, water, clothing). Now start doing it with a pack and some gear (you can substitute anything for weight if you don't want to get gear just yet). Once you can walk comfortably for a few (4-8) hours with weight over any terrain you can access easily; plan an over-night trip - carrying your gear! As for the gear you think you need - ask a specialist hiking/outdoors store, not a generic footballs and basketballs store. At a minimum you will need a hiking boots/shoes, pack, hiking clothes (raincoat, warm clothes, socks etc.), food, water container, compass, maps (and knowledge of how to use!). In addition, as per @Jason comment - you should always have a fairly comprehensive first aid kit and the knowledge on how to use. What else you need depends on where you will stay and how - if camping you need tent, sleeping bag (down is best, warmest, lightest, most compact), sleeping mat, cooker. You should also consider a GPS and emergency beacon. Most hiking gear of any decent quality is incredibly expensive, but buying quality is quite important if you are using it day-after-day - you really don't want to buy a cheap pack because it was half the price of a more expensive one, and then have it fall apart after a month of daily use, or not fit you well because the harness is poorly designed. Or for that matter, buy a cheap sleeping bag and be cold every night!\",\n",

AFAIK it is defined by a list of \"housings\" that start with a tent as the \"smallest version\" (followed by caravans, cars, mobile homes). Tarps are not in this list. \"lagern\" is taking a rest and includes laying down. You can also lay down for the purpose of watching animals, and you may need your sleeping bag for that and an umbrella or a tarp against dew or rain. There is also the concept of free landscape (outside the forest) where according to the 2nd linked article camping by tent is not explicitly forbidden. However, this does hold only if the area is not currently in agricultural use (i.e. once the hay is off the meadow, you\\'re fine, but not before) Things are fine if you ask beforehand (though in German \"wild zelten\" has a very strong connotation of not asking). I tend to do that where it is obvious where to ask, and in countries where I speak enough of the language to ask with the help of hand and feet (but not enough to discuss if I\\'m caught). Emergency camping in alpine areas is called \"biwakieren\" and is allowed. I do not need to mention that there are areas where even \"lagern\" over night is forbidden (e.g. natural reserves). There you also won\\'t be able to argue convincingly that you didn\\'t see the signs. My experience is that if you stay friendly and don\\'t leave rubbish things are OK and if someone finds you they\\'ll usually wish you a nice tour. It is no criminal offense, so even if the police or a forest officer find you, they can fine you, but they don\\'t have to . I\\'ve been \"cought\" by french gendarmes once on a hiking tour. However, when we asked where we should walk given that it was dark already we were allowed to stay over night but we had to put down the tent so the gendarmes would not need to get into discussions with the motorized crowd that had had the same idea of a nice spot for camping (and had attracted the police in the first place). (Though I know someone who was caught in a natural park outside the allowed places and had to write a \"I\\'m-sorry-and-I-won\\'t-do-it-again\"-letter and someone else who was fined) However, if it comes to a discussion, my guess is that you\\'ll have a very hard time to convince a forester that your tarp is really that different from a proper tent, and that you had to put it up because you were in an emergency (how come that night fell completely unexpected by a person who thinks so much in advance as to bring a tarp? And it is really hard to get properly lost in our small forests...). I guess the approach \"Sure, we\\'ll pack and leave immediately. Just where are we supposed to go now in the dark?\" is far more promising.

In our region (Alberta) dogwood and alder are the big ones for deer browse, but most willows, high bush cranberry, snowberry are also palatable for them. Ideal deer cover is a mixed wood with some conifer, some hardwood, some big stuff, lots of little stuff. Needs to be open enough that deer can flee predators easily, closed enough to provide shelter from winter wind. Deer are under maximum stress most years in late winter: Snow more than a few inches deep requires significant energy to move through. Running in snow is unpredicable, and is stressful on joints. Nutrient content of buds declines through the winter. Buds and twigs dry, making deer eat more snow for water. Snow that takes heat to warm up. If there has been a thaw/freeze, the snow may have a crust that cuts deer legs when they break through. Here in Alberta coyotes, being 1/3 the weight, and twice the paw size can stay on the crust when deer are breaking through. Deer population drops dramatically on those years. 10 acres is enough that you can manage it for firewood. Here, I can harvest a cord per acre per year indefinitely on poplar woods. That should also hold true for other fast growing hardwoods like silver maple. Oaks and red/sugar maple maybe half that. Try phoning your local county extension agent or horticulturalist. Many areas have some form of Wood Lot management association that shares workshops on replanting, safe use of chainsaw, selective cutting. Or Google \"wood lot {name of your state or province}\" If you want deer, put out a salt lick. Not legal during hunting season in many locales.',\n",

       "    'body': \"My wife and I have just returned from a week of hiking in and near the eastern Pyrenees, starting from Foix, having flown in to Toulouse. The train journey from Toulouse to Foix is pleasant and takes about three hours. From there we did three days on the Sentier Cathar, which follows the route of the GR107, then a day south on the GR107 to Ax les Thermes, where we spent a very pleasant day. Then we spent three days on the Carlit Massif, first along the GR10 from Merens les Vals, followed by a final day back to the end of the French train line at Entveigt / Latour les Carols, via a stretch of the Route due Carlit. It is a very lovely area, with lots of options for making up a tour of about a week. We had more guides than we needed (because I can't resist buying them, in English or French) but you could easily find your way without them, if weight was critical, using just the 1:50000 map for the area. The routes are well marked with red and white markers for the GR routes, and red and yellow for the others that we used. The guides do give you an idea of how much ascent/descent you are in for, however, and how long the day's walking is likely to take. Mind you, we always needed longer than the suggested times, but we are slow! We normally set out by 7:30-8:00 in order to get some distance behind us before the heat of the afternoon. The only places where it was remotely crowded were where we approached civilisation, for example at the Lac Bioullouse. Otherwise it was gloriously empty, and we actually liked to meet our few fellow travellers along the way when we bumped into them. At Montsegur we camped at a beautiful, simple, quiet and cheap (4 euros each!) municipal camp site. We had a tent and slept in it most nights, but mostly outside refuges when in the mountains, and at campsites or gites when lower down. Even lower down, on the Sentier Cathar, you have to think ahead as to whether there will be shops where you can buy food. In the mountains it was significantly cooler than low down, though still felt warm, and we managed OK for water by using fountains at villages when we came across them. There were plenty of opportunities for wild camping, but I didn't see anyone doing it, probably because the proximity to refuges where we were meant that it wasn't necessary. In fact, unless you are completely averse to using refuges, or are going to an area where they are not where you want them to be, you might want to consider ditching the tent and just using the refuges. I think we saved 18ish euros a night each by using our tent, but had the weight penalty instead. That said, all the hikers we saw who were doing the whole stretch from Hendaye to Banyuls, or vice-versa, by whichever route, did have tents with them. I would have loved to see a bear, but the closest I came was a marmot. We both very much want to go back and do more.\",\n",

If you have air great, breathe it. If you are in a stable spot great, use it to figure out your next move but never give up. Eddy These are whirlpools which form along the vertical axis. The form as water passes around the sides of a rock or other obstruction. Most paddlers identify eddies as islands of safety since it is one method to make river running easier and safer. In powerful enough water these \"whirl pools\" or more typically \"eddy lines\" can pull down swimmers and even boats, but they weaken as they move down stream. Waiting out the down time and moving for shore or into the main current is typically all that is needed to handle these. Starting small and experimenting with these features will give you a good idea when to play with these features and when to avoid them. Hole These are whirlpools which form on the horizontal axis as water moves over a rock or other obstruction. The current in a hole is surface water moving upstream and deep water moving downstream. At the upstream side of the hole water is plunging deep and at the downstream end water is percolating upwards. The real trick is how big are you or your boat compared to the hole. If you are very big you will stay on the surface and will likely not be stopped in the first place. If you are very small you will likely go underwater with but resurface well down stream. If you are in that magic size in the middle you will get stuck. In Boat Hole Exits In a boat there are a few strategies for exiting the feature. The first most are likely to try is reaching downstream and grabbing downstream moving water. This rarely works and most that try put their shoulders at risk. This will only work on the weakest of features. The next step is to work towards the corners of the hole. Most holes are not perpendicular to the current and \"kick\" either left or right. Don\\'t fight the kick. Sometimes this means backing out of the hole if your boat is facing the wrong way. If one side doesn\\'t seem to work try the other. If the hole pushes you back to the middle (frown shaped looking downstream) then you will need to try something different. Purposely flipping the boat might present enough surface area from your body to push you downstream. It\\'s amazing the number of features that will hold an upright boat all day but immediately flush an upside down boat. If that doesn\\'t work try throwing ends. You don\\'t need to a be a freestyle expert to try this. Just plug your bow or stern in the upstream current and the boat will go deep and vertical. The goal is to go as deep as you can to catch more of the downstream water and sometimes even jump over some recirculating water. If none of this works and help isn\\'t available an out of boat rescue may be the next move. Out of Boat Hole Exits Much like flipping seems to turn many would be keepers into a flushing hole, it\\'s amazing how many features will flush a swimmer immediately after a long a violent ride in the boat. Of coarse swimming offers it\\'s own hazards and should be avoided whenever possible. Most river fatalities occur when swimming not inside boats. If you do not flush immediately you are dealing with a very dangerous feature and not a lot of time. There is basically 3 things you can do, swim (on your belly freestyle strokes) at the edges of the holes and into upstream current, cannonball and starfish. My immediate move would be to swim aggressively into the upstream current When I hit it starfish to maximize surface area and cannonball when the jet of current pushes less to reduce surface area and go deep. If that doesn\\'t work try again and if that doesn\\'t work try a different combination of the above. Basically swim, cannonball, starfish offer 3 different moves that will work most of the time. That said not always. Some features you can\\'t get out of without help. Rescue Exits There are a number of rescue techniques for getting someone else out of a bad feature. They simplest and most common is a throw rope. Boat based rescues can also be good but can easily turn one victim into two. Use with caution. Avoidance The really good news about all this is avoidance is fairly easy. Most bad features occur at man made dams. Whenever you see one, your first instinct should be to look for a place to get out and look at the feature to see what you are dealing with. If you can\\'t read water, portage around even if it looks like a small easy drop. Naturally occurring features like this typically only happen on advanced rivers where water reading skills and setting safety are ubiquitous. The rare feature the occurs on an easier river will be well known to locals and as always they should be tapped for run information whenever possible.',\n",

I still paddle canoes, but I'm a wimp about cold water and the rivers in Minnesota mostly only run in the Spring when they are freezing, so I don't paddle whitewater any more. Now I canoe and occasionally paddle flatwater kayaks, but I like canoes better on flatwater. I sold canoes and kayaks at Midwest Mountaineering for five years, which also involved a lot of boat demos. If you are planning on doing a lot of flat water, you don't want a whitewater kayak like the Fun or Fuse. If you are planning on doing a lot of white water, you don't want a flatwater kayak. There really isn't a great crossover option because the qualities that make a good whitewater kayak are precisely the opposite qualities of a good flatwater kayak. Any crossover is necessarily a study in compromises. That said, many kayak manufacturers do make crossover kayaks that are basically flatwater kayaks with a bit less of a keel than a true touring kayak. Those with more rounded hulls often have drop skegs so you can track straight on flat water but still turn (enough) in moving water. If you intend to limit yourself to fairly light Class I and II rapids, you will probably be happy enough with a crossover like the Dagger Axis or Katana. I was fan of the old Dagger Blackwater, and these might have inherited some of its flexibility (or you could look for a Blackwater at garage sales or on Craigslist). Finally, whitewater kayaks don't really progress with you. When you start, buy a cheap used kayak. It will take a season or two for you to understand what you really want. And you'll probably only own that kayak for another year or two before you want something else. Plus, most whitewater kayakers own at least two or three kayaks because they don't all work for all rivers. Like I said above, kayaks are very purpose-built. Sometimes you want to play in a hole or on a wave, so you want something short and stubby that surfs well. Sometimes you want to run big water and stop for lunch in the middle. So you need a longer boat with some volume in it. When the water is up, you want to bash down a creek, so you need a creek boat. It's an expensive hobby, but fun as hell.\",\n",

For short stretches of even the gentlest rapids the best approach would be to tie up one boat, paddle the first down (or pole up), tie it up and walk back for the other. Continuous white water on a solo expedition (presumably far from civilisation as well, or you wouldn't need to carry so much) seems like a bad idea, even with a single boat. So your plan to avoid it is good. With two boats, you're unlikely to be able to self rescue without the loss of a boat - or both if they're tied together. So if the water is rougher than you expected (perhaps due to unexpected rainfall unsptream) you'll need to either paddle the boats one at a time or wait it out, depending on what the issue is. There may be a very tricky middle ground, which should make you very wary.

We were on a multiday canoe trip and the winds picked up on the last day when we had to cross the lake. Instead of crossing where we had camped, we decided to go downwind until we were directly across from where we wanted to be, then we crossed. The hope was that the winds would recede later in the day, so we stayed closer to shore, making headway while waiting them out. Riding the white caps downwind was easy, if you got going the right speed you could surf some of the waves as they caught up to you, and you didn't have to worry about water splashing into the canoe. Paddling across the wind wasn't as much fun, but it's doable if the waves aren't too big, you keep your craft parallel to the waves and rock at the hips when you ride up and over them. You don't want to lean into the wave when it hits the side of your craft, you want to rock your canoe slightly away from it and level out going over the top. If you don't rock your canoe with the waves, then the white caps are more likely to break over the gunwales. If the waves are too big, then you run the risk of a large enough wave capsizing your canoe. In the event of overly large waves, you should ride them down wind as much as you can. Paddling up into the wind is the fastest way to drench the person in the bow and slowly swamp your canoe. The waves come at you much more rapidly, and as you break each wave it splashes water up and into the canoe. Your paddler in the bow gets jarred in the seat with each wave you break too, and depending on the wave size and how fast you get paddling, you can even bounce them out of their seat sometimes. This is true no matter how slightly you're heading into the wind. Water breaking over the gunwales is the first indicator that you need to steer downwind a bit. Which way you choose to go depends on how big the lake is, how far you are from shore and how big the waves are. Waves start capping long before they get really big, but the longer they are capping, and the bigger the lake, the bigger the waves are going to get, so it's best to get off sooner than later and wait the winds out. If upwind is the fastest way to shore, and you can afford to take on a litter water, then go into the wind and get of the lake quicker, but downwind is always easier. Ultimately this is a judgement call that needs to be made considering all the circumstances in the event of white-capping, including the experience of the paddlers. An experienced pair of paddlers can go out in virtually any weather conditions, whereas I've seen novices capsize in perfectly calm and still waters.\",\n",

As far as other suggestions there are a few ways to handle beta. Better Pointing One method for better pointing is getting next to a the feature of note. Often I\\'ve had more novice paddlers catch an eddy close to a feature so point with my hand is not ambiguous. This allows me to talk about specifics a feature. I\\'ve done this to show new paddlers what undercuts, sieves, curling waves, eddy lines, holes, splat rocks etc etc etc look like. Likewise, simple hand signals like a paddle up when moving past a feature of note can be helpful. I would caution though, standard whitewater protocol is to \"point-to-positive\". In other words when we can\\'t communicate clearly I will point where you should be and NEVER point at hazardous features. When you can have a conversation obviously it\\'s a little different. Better descriptions The key to good beta is know how much to give. I\\'m a big fan of short and sweet with a little bit of color if needed. Start Right Move left. Enter Left and drive right to miss an undercut. Down the middle. Keep your bow up on the boofs. When you are in the rapid this stuff is a lot easier to remember and will generally result in better lines. If the simple beta isn\\'t enough beta then you probably should take a step back in difficulty. Likewise for many scouts. If you can\\'t see the lines yourself you should probably take a step back, unless you are looking at CL III water as a new boater. Blue Angel Boating Another method to fix the problem of beta is to provide brief descriptions but run rapids in a close group one after another. It\\'s one thing to say there is a ridge to boof but it\\'s difficult to identify from shore. It\\'s another to be 6 feet behind the boater who knows where they are going and following their exact line. This is one of the best methods for quickly descending rivers as it does not require a bank scout. Obviously it has it\\'s drawbacks in lack of shore safety and if the guide blows the line both of you might be in trouble. I think the fact that the boats are tightly grouped improves safety as in boats rescues are fast effective, and in many cases much safer for the rescuer.

       "    'body': 'As well stated in another answer, whitecaps (the white tips of waves) are a visual indicator of local wind speed over the water. Just wanted to add emphasis that whitecaps, as an indicator of wind, will often appear before the local formation of the sort of short, steep waves (aka “wind chop”) that can be challenging for canoes and kayaks paddled by people who are accustomed to flat water. So even if such waves are not yet present the whitecaps are an indicator that waves may be developing. Even when relatively small these waves can be treacherous when coming from behind the paddler, due to the tendency of the canoe/kayak to unintentionally surf (gain speed on the face of the wave) and then broach (turn suddenly parallel to the waves) which, along with an unpracticed reaction from the paddler, can contribute to tipping.

       "    'body': 'Since there is a great general answer already, I\\'ll add one from my experience with white water kayaks. Length: Longer boats have a higher hull speed. When moving at more than the hull speed relative to the water you\\'ll start creating waves, wasting energy. Shorter boats turn faster, and have less problems \"boofing\", going over drops without diving in nose first. Boats designed with bigger rivers in mind will often be a bit longer, the slightly longer turning time is easily offset by the higher top speed. Boats made with small and steep creeks in mind are often a little shorter. White water kayaks in general are short by flat water boat standards, as they need to be nimble. Really short boats are used for freestyle kayaking, performing tricks like cartwheels and loops. Rocker: More rocker also helps in boofing, and a pronounced rocker is on the scale of white water kayaks more important in this aspect than a short length, as well as in smoothly crashing through waves and holes. Any kayak designed for the really serious runs will have a lot of rocker. Boats designed with weaker currents in mind, or those designed for surfing, often have less rocker, or only on the front, to make sure the water doesn\\'t flow on top of the boat and push the nose under. Boats with less rocker sit shallower in the water and hit less rocks, and it helps in creating a big flat surface for the effect discussed below. Cross section: A round profile is used to create a forgiving displacement hull on serious river and creek running boats. An unexpected stream or push won\\'t take the boat off course or tip it over. Flat profiles are used for control, for instance on boats designed with surfing in mind. A large flat surface with square corners gives the boater a lot more control over the craft and more steering power, even while planing, but it also gives any unexpected currents more control over the boat. A flat boat can be a joy to pilot, it\\'s very reactive and takes little power to paddle if you\\'re using the currents right, a more round boat makes you feel like you can take on the world. A lot of round big river kayaks these days do have rails running along the sides of the boat under or around the water line, they give back some control while not making the boat significantly more punishing. White water kayaks (with the exception of downriver boats, but that\\'s its very own specialized thing) do not have anything remotely resembling an edge, rail or keel in the middle of the boat. That\\'s roughly it. Speed = long, forgiving = round, boofing = rocker, surfing = flat, freestyle = short, control = flat or rails. For a better feel of what this means, find some good pictures on manufacturers sites or comparison sites like the Playak buyer guide.',\n",

       "    'body': 'Conditions in which you can handle the boat depend on the style of boat and the paddler The range of what defines a \"covered cockpit kayak\" includes play boats from under 2 meters to over 5 meter touring and racing boats. A considerably greater variety than \"open canoe\" covers. Paddlers range from total novices to the highly experienced or internationally competitive. At one end of these scales you\\'re going to have serious difficulty travelling upwind at all under these conditions, at the other end of the scale you\\'re unlikely to really notice until conditions become significantly more adverse. Advice for each combination of boat and paddler varies. One thing you will notice is that kayaks tend to turn nose into the waves, making upwind an easier option than you might expect. The easiest way off for a short boat will always be downwind, these boats are designed to surf. They\\'ll catch a wave and you can ride it to shore. They really struggle to climb waves and you won\\'t make much progress if you turn into the wind and waves. Crosswind requires some skill at handling your boat in waves, but if you drop the edge towards the incoming waves and let it turn up the wave and ride down the back it\\'s not too bad. The chances are anyone needing this advice will be in a stable enough boat that there\\'s not a massive problem but should generally be avoided. Taking waves straight side on should also be avoided, however as already mentioned, your boat will naturally turn up into the waves as long as you keep it upright. Upwind could be your better bet in longer touring boats, racing boats or sea kayaks. The boat will naturally turn this way and it won\\'t cause any difficulties with handling. However these boats can also surf, so a good paddler should be able to take a quick ride out by going downwind. Anything above the 4 meter mark is unlikely to be slowed by small white horses, smaller touring boats will get wetter, but the point of the covered cockpit is to allow you to stay out in considerably more adverse conditions than open boats can handle. In summary: A competent kayaker in a suitable boat doesn\\'t actually need to head off the lake at the point where white horses are starting to form, however beginners should take an exit that suits their abilities and their boat. The plural of anecdote isn\\'t data: As a general rule once the white horses start appearing I treat it like a resistance session and dig in. I\\'m usually in a polo boat which isn\\'t designed to handle at all in big water, however I\\'m also not your average recreational paddler. I advise beginners to stay away from areas where the waves tend to build when the wind picks up. Storm in a teacup Don\\'t try this at home! I was thinking of this question as I was out on the lake on Sunday morning, the image is the output of the weather station on our base. Since we don\\'t get conditions like this very often, I took the opportunity to test both long and medium boats. (I don\\'t fit well in the small boats, and in these conditions I wasn\\'t going to take anything unfamiliar.) The sea kayaks (P&H Delphin) were great both up and downwind, surfed nicely with the wind behind us (skeg down), coming off the surf at speed onto the crosswind leg with limited space was less fun, but they were also no problem at all upwind. Polo boat (EXO XP3) 3metres low volume. This is not a boat I\\'d normally recommend anyone take under such conditions, it\\'s fundamentally a flat water boat. Downwind it was a handful in the surf, constantly trying to broach (no skeg of course) and preferring to be half submerged if at all possible. In big water you want to keep your nose up and on this boat any lift under the tail the nose goes down (feature not a bug). Coming onto the crosswind leg it started behaving itself. Upwind it tends to sit level and let the waves roll over the top. That\\'s not actually a problem and it paddles nicely even half underwater. This is as much an example of the difference between closed kayaks and others such as sit on tops, open canoes and paddleboards. Only a closed kayak could be used even under our controlled conditions in the storm. Any other type would have washed up battered on the lee shore in fairly short order.',\n",

For difficult places, it is normal for me to stand outside and talk about which lines are good and which places to avoid. More experienced people can simply point out salient features to each other, \"Go right after you have boofed over that ridge, with enough time to steer clear of the undercut rock\". I am still at the stage where I have to learn how to recognize a barely visible ridge, to know where I will need to boof, to spot which one of the dozens of rocks is undercut. As pointing with a finger only gets us so far, I thought of using a laser pointer. I even found a model which is waterproof (meant for divers). But I am reluctant to try it, as it is expensive enough to hurt if it turns out to be useless. if I get a laser pointer, will I be able to see the dot on the water surface? assuming that it works, what would be the minimal strength required to see the dot in direct sunlight? Again assuming that it works, which colors will work? I was surprised to read some diver mentioning that underwater, green is better than red, but have no idea if this will hold for the surface. The water surface reflects more like a mirror than like a random solid surface - will this be as damaging for the eyesight as having the pointer itself pointed directly at the eyes? Yes, the water is probably somewhat foamy, but it tends to have still places too. are there other potential problems with my idea? are there easier solutions to the same problem?

       "    'body': 'Much depends on wave size. A sudden strong wind will kick up small white caps on a short reach. Not much to worry about. Give the wind 10 km or so of water to run over and it doesn\\'t much wind to kick up large waves. Canoes generally are loaded stern heavy. If you travel downwind, you can get to the point where waves are breaking around the steersman. The bow weathervanes downwind, and is very difficult to point to a quartering run to shore. If you are going to paddle on windy waters, learn to trim your canoe to make it more controllable in wind. When going into the wind there is a size of wave where the bow is in the crest, the middle is in the trough, and and the bow can\\'t rise fast enough to keep water from coming in over the bow. This is why you often will quarter (meet the waves at a 30 to 60 degree angle) This is often a useful technique in haystacks on rapids. Having waves directly on your beam is very unsettling, and requires practice, and a really solid low brace. The hazard also depends on how heavily loaded you are. Bill Mason in one of his films is out on one of the great lakes playing in the surf. But it\\'s an empty canoe, and he\\'s better than most of us. Anyway, a lightly loaded canoe rises to the waves faster. Day tripping vs weekend trip vs month long expedition will give very different results. Generally even with a couple weeks stuff, on small lakes, the being able to control your canoe in the wind is a more serious problem than the white caps are. I used to work with a school that sent voyageur style canoes (21-26 feet long 6-9 people per canoe) all over Canada. These canoes are more heavily laden than tandem canoes are, drawing 6-9 inches of water and having about a foot of freeboard in the middle. Our group\\'s safety manual specified: With significant whitecaps, travel was to be within 1/2 km from shore. (Option to get to shore quickly if conditions got worse) If the wind was blowing off shore, travel was to be closer to the shore than the whitecaps. (Off shore winds can push you further off shore to where both wind and waves are much larger) In the event of a squall or sudden wind, head to shore, quartering if wave size warranted. An experienced (senior) staff member acts as sweep, watching for trouble, and making sure everyone gets to shore. We traveled on some serious water: Superior, Reindeer, Wollaston, Athabasca, Great Slave, as well as many lakes that were \"only\" large enough to not have a visible far shore. Mountain lakes are even more dangerous, as you can see less sky, and the winds are far less constant. I have been on Lake Abraham (N. Saskatchewan River) and have had winds go from 30 kph headwinds to calm to the same speed as a tailwind in the space of minutes. Going into the wind we were confident. Shore was close, and you could see the waves break. Once it became tail wind, we went to shore and waited it out.',\n",

Hydraulics Faster flowing water has additional hazards. submerged rocks, and out cropping of shore may cause \"Hydraulics\", \"Eddy Currents\" and other invisible currents, if you do not have a good understanding of what to look for you may be unable to get to the shore, even in a small creek, or you may get sucked into a \"hole\" a churning current which can trap you in a vertical loop, letting you surface for just a second before dragging you along the bottom of the river, and repeating this until you get free or drown. Sweepers When a tree has fallen into, or over a stream or river bank in such a manner its in somewhat perpendicular with the water, this is called a sweeper. If a swimmer gets entangled with a sweeper it can \"sweep\" you down and the water pins you to the tree or its branches, the most dangerous sweepers are fallen trees with many limbs, which can make it harder to self rescue. There are many more hazards to moving water, I am by no means an expert, but even when the water is moving more slowly [in a pool, under a waterfall etc] many people die due to bad judgment. these pools look quite deep in relation to the rapids, but may be much shallower than they look.

Most of the strainers that you will (unfortunately) come across are likely to be formed by trees and wooden logs. When I could feel being pressed under, I realized that swimming defensively isn't helping at all. Few things to start with: When it rains damn heavy over a day, you can see abrupt rise in water level. Avoid going rafting/kayaking or if you are already out, avoid taking narrow paths in such a situation. That said, you should also consider other water bodies and hazards they may pose. These are easy to locate, whenever you are passing through a narrow water passage with thickets, small trees in contact with the water stream, keep your eyes peeled. Its a perfect place for a strainer to form. If you locate one such strainer, try to get closer to the shore. If you can't and are sure that you are going to go at it, be alert, aggressive. You are likely to be tossed up from your ride. In such a case swim aggressively towards the strainer and with the pace try to stay somewhat above the water that passes below the logs and loft yourself on the log instead letting it swallow you. By aggressive swimming here, I meant go head-first, just when you are about to hit the log, loft up and grab the log, keep your torso up and out of the water. When you can't get around it, go over it with pace. Most of the people who get trapped under one such strainer, have their legs locked in water and thats why they can't get out of the water and get swallowed. So, Try and get your feet up on the surface, that should help you get out quickly with the help of the strong water current. If at all you have to rescue someone out of a strainer, start from the sideways or downstream. Never go upstream as you may end-up at the same place as the victim.

Similarly, and sometimes just as dangerously, there are areas of the sea that can \"pull you along\" the coast horizontally. This can sometimes be dangerous simply because it\\'s much easier to miss, and can pull you into dangerous areas such as: River outflows : Along the same guise as currents, but these can often hide at full tide and seem to appear very suddenly and strongly if you move into them. Quicksand : Not often thought of when you\\'re in the water, but if you decide to stay on the bottom for a while and hit a patch of this, it can root you to the spot. Watercraft : Again, something that\\'s often missed, but stray jetskis (for example) can seriously injure or kill you if they hit you full on. Hidden depth : While you can often expect beaches to fall down at a gentle angle, there are often hidden areas that can suddenly drop away. While not an inherent problem if you\\'re a good swimmer, these can often be associated with undercurrents too - so beware. Personally I\\'ll only swim on beaches I\\'m familiar with at high tide (and have seen at low tide) to try and mitigate this somewhat. Wildlife : This varies greatly - some areas can have deadly sharks (or similar) in them, and these risks go without saying! However, bear in mind more common things such as jellyfish (some of which will just give you a nasty sting and others that can be lethal) and crabs (which will give you a nasty nip if feeling threatened.) Know what lives in the waters you\\'re swimming in, and be prepared accordingly. Sharp rocks : This goes hand in hand with wildlife in that sharp limpets can also live on rocks, making matters worse - but just because the entrance into the water looks sandy, doesn\\'t mean it is all the way through. If you swim at high tide and stay in while the sea recedes, you may find yourself painfully clamouring over all types of nasties. Same goes if an unexpected large wave throws you against such rocks. Pollution : Like any body of water, you should be aware of pollution - especially after storms many runoffs will quickly head into the sea containing a variety of toxins and bacteria. In some countries / areas factories are still permitted to dump waste into the sea directly, in this case I wouldn\\'t even risk getting in the water!',\n",

You find a place where you can cross safely, given your strength and balance. This may mean a significant detour. First, for below timberline: Scout upstream and downstream for a log that has fallen across the stream. You will eventually find one that you are able to cross on. You may have to walk on the \"wrong\" side of the stream longer than you really want to, but be patient . By wrong side of the stream, I mean the side where the trail isn\\'t; it\\'s probably overgrown and/or hilly and hard going. But you will find a log. Second, for above timberline: Walk upstream past several confluences of minor streams with the main stream and eventually the main stream will be crossable. If this is a longer detour than you really want to make, be patient ! On a day hike, never cross a barely crossable snow-melt stream in the morning unless you know of a much easier place to re-cross it in the afternoon. Snow-melt streams can enlarge dramatically during a day of melting. As for how to cross that stream in Iceland without a wading staff if one is alone, the OP did not ask that question and I don\\'t know how to answer it. If there are several people, see this question, especially the answer by Lagerbaer If I have to cross an icy, flowing river, what are some ways I can cross safely? As for swimming the lake, as the OP contemplated, unless you know the temperature of the lake and the temperature you can tolerate in a swim, it seems risky. See Swimming to Antarctica by Lynne Cox. Lynne, a well insulated young woman specializing in long, cold swims, swam across Lake Myvatn in Iceland as part of her training to swim the Bering Strait from Little Diomede to Big Diomede.

The problem answering the question in a more straight forward manner you have waterfalls like victoria falls (pictured below) that would almost certainly result in a fatal fall if you were to go over, but the chance of flushing over even when on the edge of the waterfall are low because of the depth and flow at the lip. To Contrast here is huka falls, a waterfall that even hundreds of meters upstream you cannot safely cross because of the heavy currents and lack of exit points from the river. In general you should avoid any water crossing with any meaningful current; unless you have whitewater experience or you can maintain your footing, shin deep or less, the entire time. In an emergency type scenario ropes can be helpful to mitigate risks, but require careful application as they add complexity to a potentially dangerous situation. Again experience goes a long way. Edit: I should probably add the Victoria falls is not actually travesable all the way across the lip, but was used as an extreme example of getting close to a lip of a waterfall in one location.

Depending on the intensity of the flow, you may want to start upstream of where you want to be on the bank on the other side, and back step a little with each side step making your way to your landing at an angle, it's a lot easier to work with the current than it is to fight it. You can use the rocks in the water to help you with your footing, feel for them with your feet as you shuffle them to the side, and plant your foot in front of rocks that feel steady with you heel on the rock. Take small controlled steps so you don't lose your balance, and don't pick your feet up higher than you have to. Step too high or too far and the current is going to take your foot away.

Swimming results is lower numbers due to fresh cold water passing the sides of your torso and groin. I suggest you do a controlled experiment. Experiment 1: In a public pool swim laps equal to the width of the river times some safety factor. I would suggest 2. Tow your gear in a dry bag. Record your time. Experiment 2: Do this with a line attached, a friend on shore at the other end of the line, and suitable warm car or fire nearby. Start well upstream of your parking point, unless you are a very strong swimmer. Swim in the river parallel to the shore for a time equal to experiment 1. Get out, open your drybag, dress, and walk two miles. My suspicion is that you will find that it\\'s not a good idea. At summer camp we had a pair of twins that could do a mile swimming in 22 minutes, which implies 1000 feet in under 5. They were skinny like rakes. They were also state champions. Bronze medallion, a common standard for swimming for supervising water related programs requires 500 yards in 15 minutes. By extension that is a mile is 50 minutes or just over a mile an hour. You are going to be in a stream that you say has a significantly faster flow than this. Which means even given laminar flow, you would go downstream about 2.5 times the width -- half a mile -- while crossing 1000 feet, assuming that you kept at right angles to the shore. Me: I would consider doing this as a bet with a safety boat during the summer when the water temps are above 21 C (70 F) as I know from experience I can spend an hour in such water and only be very cold. I would not attempt it in winter except to escape a pack of Zombies. Story time: I had a group of kids in voyageur canoes on the Athabasca River in September. The week before had been cool and wet, and the rain on the Athabasca icefield raised the river to flood levels. The glacier only being about 60 km upstream chilled the river to somewhere between 3 and 5 degrees C. Partway through the first day my canoe dumped in a class I rapid. Another canoe got a line to us, and attempted to tow us to shore. Everytime they would get into slower water we would pass them and drag them out. Finally, with a doubled line and them going the full length downstream before attempting to get to shore we were successful. All the kids still had enough coordination and strength to hold on to the gunwale throughout this, but we were in the water for about half an hour. The third canoe in the group went to shore and started a fire once it was clear this attempt would work. We got the kids to walk down to the fire, and got everyone out of cold wet clothes. This was not trivial. Fingers were cold enough that we couldn\\'t feel the buttons or zipper tabs. had a hard time gripping fabric. One thin boy was cold enough to be irrational. we had to sit him on a log and one person stood behind him with hands on his shoulders to keep him from walking into the fire. Point of this story: These were kids who moved minimally while in cold water, were wearing wool mackinaws or sweaters, were in water several degrees warmer than your winter river will be. Once on shore they were barely functional. You still have to dress yourself on the far side of the river. Your fingers won\\'t do what you tell them. Your feet will be numb. You won\\'t be able to feel what you are walking on, nor feel injury to your feet. Things like this take preparation. If you seriously want to do this, try it in summer first. The first time you do it, do it with a life jacket on. My experience with the North Saskatchewan, a river with similar current, but narrower width is there is significant turbulence that will pull you down at unexpected moments. Alternatives. Canoe. Keep a cheap canoe at work. For this use a coleman pipe frame canoe is fine. Inflatable boat. Likely more expensive than the canoe, and you can\\'t count on it being intact after years of storage. In either of these cases, practicing is essential. You need to be reasonably proficient with using them in normal temps to have a prayer of using them under adverse circumstances. Bicycle. A bike can get through when cars are jammed up. A 14 mile detour = 28 miles = 2+ hours. Even if you have to go 2 bridges down, you will get home in about 1/3 the time it would take to walk, certainly within 24 hours. Moped. Bike with a tiny engine to augment your efforts. Call it 1/2 to 2/3 the time of a bike. Small scooter. The ones you see all over the orient used as commuter vehicles. Faster than a moped, and a lot less effort. Again: Practice. Commute at least once a month this way so you can find out it\\'s and your limits. What\\'s it like biking in a cold winter rain? A comment points out that earthquakes severe enough to take down bridges may also take out sewer lines. I\\'ve no idea how fast the river would become contaminated.

I was once kayaking with my GF in Florida when I was in my early 20s and still very althletic ally capable. We kayaked through a tidal creek, and the tide was on its way out. We were drifting down stream. The river looks navigable for power craft, but it really isn\\'t and so there were three piles barring passage for anything larger than say 4 ft wide. The water was only moving maybe 2 MPH, maybe 3. It was moving slower than I walk. The kayak turned with the eddies and The kayak got pinned with my bow and stern across two of the piles. I say pinned. I was stuck in the seat and under water from the chest down. I wasn\\'t in any immediate danger because the kayak was pinned so hard it was stable.

       "    'body': 'When it\\'s possible you will be crossing ice on your route, there is a couple of stages: Planning at home First of all, you should explore the area of your trip. The question is are the water sources frozen and how thick is the ice Small lakes in the forest, where there is no winds and no water flow, freeze first. If you know that a couple of small lakes in the area froze a week or two ago, then you can assume that all the other have probably frozen too. Big lakes, which are visible from satellites, can be checked directly on MODIS daily satellite images . After you find the lake on the image (which is difficult) you can tell if it\\'s frozen by its color: white is frozen, dark is open water. If the lake is frozen, you should check a week or two back to see if it was already frozen and there were any chances for the ice to thicken. Very big lakes (like, >100 km^2) may be partially frozen for months. You can see it on the images. You\\'ll have smooth white fields near the shores (fixed ice), dark open water in the middle, and mixed dark/white pattern in between - floating ice. The trick is that fixed ice may split off and start floating any time, if it\\'s near the edge (and sometimes far from the edge too). On the other hand, sometimes local authorities publish ice coverage maps for very big lakes. Rivers are very treacherous. You can examine other rivers to roughly estimate that there is (or isn\\'t) some ice on your river, but you should concider width and speed of the current. But river ice is not uniform and most rivers have areas open during the whole winter (where the current is faster and at shallow places). They may be very hard to detect, so you\\'d better just cross rivers and avoid walking along the river. And give the ice some time to thicken. This depends on the temperature much. I\\'m not going to give any numbers here, each case is unique. If you are going far from home, it\\'s wise to ask locals about ice situation. Estimating on the spot Now you are following your route and have a (probably) frozen water in front of you. It doesn\\'t mean you have to cross it. First, think it over again, because going back is less evil than dying or having your chilblain fingers amputated. Check if there is any trace of open water. Avoid areas, where snow seems darker or lower. Avoid areas near water plants and rocks. If it\\'s spring, avoid areas near shores (they unfreeze faster). Stop right away if you feel vibration or hear cracking. Never test ice strength with a kick of you foot, use a long pole instead (this applies mostly to crossing rivers, because you are not going to strike with a pole after each step on a big lake). Unfortunately, there is no method to test that the ice is 99% safe. You are the closest when you know that a couple of people (N times as heavy as you/your party) have crossed it 5 minutes ago, but still... Yes, you can use an ice screw to test ice thickness, but you can\\'t do it all the time. Alleviating the concequences of accidents If you have fallen into the water, it\\'s very difficult to escape yourself: you are cold you get stiffer every second you may panic ice is too slippery and/or too fragile to climb your clothes and equipement (backpack, skies) make it much worse there may be underwater currents pulling you under the impenetrable \"roof\" of thick ice The main advice is Have another person following ( but not closely! ). He will have much more chances to help you. He should have a rope ready (you too, because he might accidently fall). He should not come too close to avoid following you into the water. He should be quick. You both shouldn\\'t panic. He will have much better success starting fire (or calling ambulance). Other advices are: Drop your equipement as fast as possible (your backpack\\'s belt should be unfastened all the time and you ski binding should allow underwater unfasteneing). Drop your heavy clothes too, it\\'s wet anyway. Have a personal awl (a sharp metallic piece with a handle) very accessible (like hanging at your sholder) to climb slippery ice. Or at least use youe ski poles, etc. Have matches/lighter in a waterproof package close to skin, so that you can start a fire immediately after rescue. If it\\'s possible, have an inflatable boat with you (I mean, inflated and tied to a roap in your hand). A warm diving suit + lifejacket + a boat make crossing not-so-frozen lakes quite easy and safe (tried it myself). When you are out it\\'s very important to get warm ASAP. And if the warming has to be delayed, move intensively. If you don\\'t feel your fingers, swing your arm/leg about 50 times like a pendulum with full force. If you still can\\'t feel the fingers, you can only save them by slowly warming it. And, yes, fingers are not as important as life. Bottom line Ice safety is very complex and this topic can\\'t cover anything. Take ice seriously. Really. It\\'s deadly and it\\'s not an exaggeration. Lots of unprepared people fall and die each winter. And I know half a ski-tour group with an experienced leader drown two years ago on a big lake. I know two sportsman lost their fingers after unsuccessfully crossing a small river. I know a very experienced and fully prepared man escaped just with a couple of deep cuts on his face - he was lucky. If you seriously plan crossing ice in a remote area, please be prepared, find a book or big article on the subject, consult with an experienced one and use your brains. And still it\\'s solely your responsibility.',\n",

I got my knowledge purely out of experience and not out of books, i paddled down the whole Rhine and in the process of it i had to change direction a few times, so i\\'ll try to provide you with a rundown of the essential learnings. A River just flows downstream if you\\'ve never been on a river, if you\\'ve ever been on water (this includes the bathtub) the first thing you\\'ll notice is that water is a very dynamic Element, the current of the water is dependent on multiple factors. How wide is the river How deep is the river How fast is the river Is the riverbed flat (like in canals) or is it a natural riverbed with inconsistencies like large rocks etc. Weather conditions (e.g. wind) All of this factors play a major role on a river, especially everything that happens above the water (weather) because you\\'ll most likely got the biggest surface above the water. Below i tried to scribble my thoughts, as you see there are different signs from which you can read the river, see list below with explanations. Riverbed gets deeper - this will slow down the river, since the same amount of water has more space to flow. Riverbed gets shallow - this will speed up the river, because there\\'s less space for the same amount of water to flow, you can identify those spots by the \"mushrooms\" the water will build here. If the riverbed falls back down again like in my scribble watch out because there might be a whirl under the surface which will feel like something is sucking your paddle down. Flat riverbed - not much surprises here, those are the parts where you can eat your lunch etc. Large Stones etc. in riverbed/uneven - You\\'ll be able to identfy those spots by the waves building there, depending on the speed of the river this will result in whitewater, avoid this parts with your Canoe, speed of river will change between superfast and reverese. Now more details for your question \"how to travel upstream\" At the outer side of curves you\\'ll have the current with you, this is very counterintuitive, as you see you\\'ll have to change the side of the river from time to time, more about this topic later on. Always keep in mind that sharp stones under the surface are most likely to be at the side of the river, depending on the waterlevel this leads to capsizing or a broken boat. To change Sides of the river, you\\'ll need to do some ferrying (see scribble below) this is probably one of the most hectic things you have to do. Because you don\\'t want to lose distance here, and if not everybody works together you\\'ll end up needing to cross the river again because you traveled back and need to get to the outer side again. If you travel downstream it\\'s very counterintuitive since you have to paddle backwards to ferry across a river. In general going upstream is not much of a problem, if you know how to read the water. Just as a reminder, make sure to wear safetyequipment (livevests, and tethers) so you minimize the risk of drowning. Rivers no matter how they look have the risk of strong underwater currents which are not always possible to read, those currents really drag you down with no chance of ever catching a bit air again, always keep this in mind and you\\'ll be save.

If you are going to sail it then I would advise you stay close to shore where you can swim it in and recover on shore. On solid ground could push the mast and then bail.

I know this question is about if you \"have\" to cross it, but bear in mind that falling in is a real danger and if you do, hypothermia can onset very quickly and be deadly. It depends on the situation - if we\\'re talking about a shallow, wade-able body of water that\\'s not much more than a stream I\\'d be much less hesitant to give it the go-ahead than if we\\'re talking about something 20ft deep and triple that in width! Sometimes your gut reaction can be good here, if you think it looks highly risky and you might not make it successfully, don\\'t attempt it! And if you can\\'t swim strongly and you\\'re just relying on trying to balance on top of a few logs without falling in, don\\'t even think about it. If you decide you to cross it: Look for a bridge - No, seriously. Some people really can miss the obvious. Prepare - Be sure to prepare thoroughly first. Re-pack your rucksack so all the vitals you\\'ll need are kept as dry as they can be, and accessible (you\\'ll want things like chemical heating packs, stoves, fire fuel and dry, warm clothes to all be very handy when you reach the other side.) Find a good point to cross - As a general rule avoid deep, fast flowing water. It\\'s better to find somewhere that might be a bit wider, but shallower and easier overall. If the river narrows at a particular point don\\'t be fooled, the water has to have gone somewhere and unless it\\'s branched off to another stream, it\\'s because it\\'s gone down - i.e. it\\'s deeper! Wider patches are generally shallower, slower flowing and therefore a better choice even if it seems like you\\'ve got more of a task ahead of you to cross. There are also other telltale signs you can look out for - reeds for instance tend to thrive better in shallower water. Find a good time to cross - Leave yourself plenty of time before it gets dark - it may take longer than you think, and you don\\'t want a lack of light providing an unnecessary complication. I\\'d advise crossing late morning if you can at all - that way you ensure you get plenty of light which crosses one of the list of things to worry about (and it\\'s an easy one to cross off) and you also ensure that you get to the other side when the day, on average, should be warmest. If anyone\\'s fallen in or got wet, you\\'ll be glad of every little bit of heat you can get to warm you back up! Stay out of the water if you can - See if there are any materials around which you could use to construct a raft or similar. The best thing to avoid getting frozen solid is to stay out of the water in the first place. Equally, try and see if you could build a bridge with logs or any other suitable material. Rope yourself to a secure point on the bank..? - This is a contentious one. I initially recommended it because the plus side is that you won\\'t get swept away in a current, the minus side is that it could get caught or pull you under. Judge the situation accordingly, but if you do use it, use a quick release karabiner to attach it to yourself (so you can remove it quickly and easily if you have to.) As soon as you\\'re across, get the heating supplies out - It may well be that adrenaline is keeping you going and you\\'re colder than you think. Equally even if you feel ok, the next person of your team to cross may not be. Make the most of this by getting a fire going if you can, get warm clothes out, and keep an eye out for each other to make sure everyone\\'s ok.

       "    'body': \"There are three factors that might cause this. Lack of Paddling Speed If you are moving too slowly, you will be hit by the wave rather than catching it. You should be feeling like you are joining the wave. This will require some time to build up paddling strength and technique. The last three strokes need to be big. Stretch out long in front, submerse your arm nearly to the elbow and pull back all the way. Beginners typically stroke too short, and only with their hands. Lack of speed at takeoff is likely the main problem. Timing Sometimes you will miss a wave because you are slightly too far from the shore. Other times, you'll be too close. This can cause a nosedive as the wave is too steep at the point you are catching it. Practice by looking at waves and predicting exactly where they will break. You should not be hit by whitewater as you catch the wave, but it needs to be steep enough to move you forward. Miss it: too far out. Hit by whitewater: too close to shore. Weight Distribution Your board needs to be horizontal as you paddle. The nose must not be sticking up in the air. If it is, the tail will be dragging too deep in the water. Nearly everyone gets this wrong initially. When your board is angled, you can not obtain enough speed. As a result, you will be almost stationary as the wave tumbles. Instead of picking up speed and sliding down the face, you are rotated forwards by the wave. Nose in air while paddling: too far back. Nose under water: too far forward. Nose should be on the surface. When a surfer jumps to their feet, the weight shifts backwards considerably. But this happens as the board is starting to plane. They are not in that position they catch the wave. You need to be central on the board. Once you feel it start to accelerate, you can slide back and remain lying down. Each of these things plays a part. Improvement in any factor will increase the number of good waves you catch.\",\n",

So, you're in a largish lake, you are wearing your PFD and clinging to your right-side up boat which is so full of water you believe you can't get in it without sinking it, or you believe you're not able to get into it. What should you do? Get in it. This is best proven to yourself by practice, but the more water that is in a boat the easier it is to get in. The gunwales are closer to the surface, you can kind of slither over them. You should put a fair amount of effort into getting in before you do anything else. If there are two people, one can help push the other in, who can then help pull the other. Once in you can bail, you can paddle to shore while full of water, you can sit and rest and maybe warm up. If you absolutely cannot get in, swim to shore. Ideally, push the boat there, or take a rope end with you and when you get there, pull the boat to yourself. (Pay attention to how deep it is - you may be able to stand and walk which will make bringing the boat easier.) Horrible weather may make that impossible and may be why you tipped in the first place. When the weather is bad, don't paddle right down the centre of wide lakes - stay closer to shore to make this rescue process feasible. But if you can't get the boat to shore, settle for getting yourself to shore. If you have an emergency bag in the boat (mine is a waist pack with matches, medications, a bit of food, a knife, etc) take it with you. With a PFD you can swim a long way, during which time you can think about how foolish it was to be so far from shore. Once on shore, focus on drying out, warming up, seeing what you have and if possible getting more of your stuff. Perhaps a bag is still floating and you can go get it? Take off your wet stuff and wring it out. Choose between putting it back on and hanging it up. Get a fire going if you can. Eat something if you can. Even a handful of candy will perk up your brain. If you have your boat and paddle and are uninjured, go home. You can probably claim for your stuff on your insurance. If you don't have a boat and paddle, or someone is hurt, make that fire very smoky, set up whatever kind of camp you can, and when someone gains a little more strength, consider trying to go get more of your stuff so that people can last until rescue comes.\",\n",

The bet was to stay in 1 minute up to our chins. We both made it, and were cold for half an hour. In our school program we require that all canoe trips start with a training camp that includes dumping and rescue practice. On two occasions we have done this on lakes that still had pan ice. We do NOT attempt to do a floating rescue under these conditions, but instead get people out of the water into another canoe as fast as possible. Dumping was done dressed for the weather. Clothing helps you to maintain some function for longer. I've dumped in the Athabasca River in September. The Athabasca is sourced from the Columbia Icefield, and was running high. Temperatures were likely around 5 C. We were in the water for about 25 minutes. We were all at the uncontrolable shivering stage of hypthermia by the time we got out, and getting out of our wet clothing was difficult. The key with this sort of swimming is to have an out. Stay near shore. Do not venture into currents Do not swim where you will need to grab something to get out. Have a buddy ready and able to rescue you. With experience you will learn what your reasonable limits are. Note that one of the symptoms of hypothermia is loss of judgement. If you want to prolong the time you have in the water, wear a wet suit. It will not keep you warm, but it will keep you less cold. Wearing polypro longjohns under your wet suit will help.\",\n",

The river will likely become deadly after an earthquake strong enough to take your bridge out, even if it is slow and peaceful during normal times.

There might also be a broken power line or underground power cable, maybe even running through the bridge you mentioned, submerged in the river.

       "    'body': \"These are main things that you would do. For most flow: Paddle upstream: What you'll do most of the time when there isn't much flow. Eddy-hop: Moving between the relatively still/upstream flowing parts of the river - they usually occur around bends at the sides of the river, outcrops rock in the middle of the flow or sides or, at nodes in waves(and the like). You ferry-glide between these until you get where you want to. There's a tome about it in another answer. Ferry-gliding is a way of crossing flow by using it's force to push you across, here's a diagram: And here's what a river looks like. You can see that the flow is going from to bottom but at certain places it flow back up. You can go up in these and then ferry-glide across to the next. Below: For Rapids (big and small): Poling: This is moving the boat by means of a long pole (about 4 metres long, normally kept in two screw-together parts in the boat). There are two main techniques: using it to push you upstream(or down-stream) by standing up and pushing off the river-bed. This is ideal for getting up short bits that are a bit too shallow to use a paddle with or would be just a bit too hard so you use the pole as it gets more purchase off the river-bed. like this: You can also pole in deeper water by pushing it off the water, kind of like a stringy paddle-wheel, but this probably isn't too useful for going upstream. Lining/Tracking: These are ways of bringing a boat up or down a rapid by means of ropes, controlled from the bank. One denotes bringing it upstream and the other downstream and y'know, I just can't remember which is which. Anyway, the general idea is that you get two ropes and attach one to the front and one to the back of the canoe. It's a little like flying a kite. You want to keep the front of the boat pointed out into the middle of the flow so that the water keeps it there and not crashing into the bank beside you, but also move upstream. It's a lot easier with two people but can be done with one. And well, sometimes what you're doing will just amount to dragging. Back rope: Main pulling rope, pulls the boat upstream, must ensure that it's not let out further than the front. Front rope: Controls angle of the boat to the flow. The front needs to be further away from the bank you're on than the rear but not so far that the flow exerts more force than you can handle. It needs to be further out so that you can control it with the tension of the rope, if it were nearer you would need to push it back and a rope wouldn't be much use. Video Portaging : I'm afraid that sometimes you might have to get out and walk, lift, drag and curse at the boat until you get it where you want it. ps. there's obviously many ways of doing all of these things and there are variations on all of techniques.\",\n",

The throw bag also gives an obvious floating target and flies well (for a difficult throw with a long line current teaching is to clip on a carabiner as the added weight gives more distance and accuracy). Throwing a rope to a sunken victim is a recipe for failure especially if there's even the slightest current. A personal flotation device is a good idea if the risk of entering the water unexpectedly is significant. Current teaching (in white water rescue) is also to avoid loops that could twist round body parts so the bag gives something to grab. You'd only restuff a bag if you had plenty of time - for a rethrow, coiling (actually lap coiling) is recommended. Throw lines also come in two main types - light, flat ropes designed for ease of throwing, and much stronger, heavier ropes which can be used in other rescue and recovery techniques. A light bag of 15 or 20 metres isn't particularly expensive. So to improvise, forget the bag and throw a rope. There may be some margin to tying a sealed, empty plastic bottle on the throwing end, but you'd want to practice this in advance - it might be too light as the bag is weighted by the remaining rope and the bottle isn't.\",\n",

Avoiding trouble clothing and food (including drink): as with any outdoor activity, it\\'s important to avoid fatigue and hypothermia. Poor decision-making is the start of most problems, and reduces your ability to correct them. One of the most useful items is a thin thermal balaclava, which I use to regulate heat loss from my head. It takes very little space in a pocket, and really reduces the effect of cold winds. map / chart and tide tables (or tide times for the planned journey): make sure you know where you\\'re going, and what places to avoid. Be aware of tidal streams that could increase the effective distance you\\'ll paddle. I keep the most useful map on deck in a clear case, so I can read it as I go. GPS receiver : although not essential, it\\'s a handy backup to the map, and I get a psychological boost from having a distance countdown to my next destination. I\\'m using a small handheld that I also use for hillwalking, with maps from OpenStreetMap; these include most of the Aids to Navigation in my area, and I contribute back any corrections I discover. I always carry spare batteries - usually 1-2 days\\' worth more than I expect to need. VHF radio : The local coastguard station transmits regular safety announcements, with weather forecast every 3 hours, military operations notices a couple of times a day, and other safety information as required. It\\'s really useful to be able to alter plans in advance of a change in the weather. Also, for longer crossings, I contact the coastguard at start and end of the crossing - it\\'s useful to phone them from land before the trip to give vessel details, so you only need to give your callsign on the radio. Getting out of trouble buoyancy aid : Pretty obvious; everyone has one. A simple one is fine, though paying extra will get you features such as pockets (my pockets hold the VHF, beacon and balaclava; there\\'s also a pouch holding a drinks bladder, but you can keep one on deck). paddle float : Re-entry is much, much easier with extra buoyancy on the blade. split paddle : I\\'ve never lost my paddle (I made an elastic leash to keep it with the boat), but you can\\'t do much without one, so I always carry a spare on the rear deck. pump : Another obvious one; this is the fastest way to empty the cockpit of water once you\\'re in it again. first aid kit : Usually, this is a small kit for cuts and scrapes; perhaps also a support bandage for strains and sprains. If travelling in company, you can make use of treatments for more serious injuries. I think that what to include in a first aid kit is a good question in its own right. Getting help VHF radio : mentioned above in \"avoiding trouble\", having a DSC set with in-built GPS enables it to transmit your location in a mayday call, reducing the chances of miscommunicated information. Make sure you know how to use it properly - the Short-Range Communication course and exam will likely cost you less than the set itself; it allows you to operate legally, and it\\'s fun! Carry a spare battery, too. beacon : An emergency position-indicating radio beacon (EPIRB) uses satellite communication to send an alert to the international rescue coordinators when you trigger it. It is important to register your beacon with your country\\'s authorities, so your alert will be recognised as genuine. It\\'s probably best to carry it on your person, rather than in the boat, in case you get separated somehow. If you\\'re counting, this is the third GPS unit I have on board (and that\\'s not counting the one in my camera). flares : A small tub of flares sits behind my seat or in the day-hatch, to guide rescuers to an exact position. Currently, I have two handheld orange smoke and two red pinpoint. They only operate for a short time, so you\\'d want to save them until you can see (or at least hear) your rescue approaching - even better if you\\'re in radio contact and can be told when to use them. These have a limited shelf life, and need to be replaced after a few years (and the unused ones disposed of responsibly). strobe light and reflective markings : Although I don\\'t intentionally paddle after dark, in an emergency situation these can help improve your visibility to others, supplementing the flares. My kayak top and buoyancy aid both include reflective patches; if yours don\\'t, it may be worth sticking or stitching some one for yourself. I choose Lithium cells for the batteries in the strobe - these have a very long shelf life, so are more likely to work even if you haven\\'t thought about changing them for 5 or 10 years. There are a few things I could have listed above but have chosen not to carry for various reasons: tow line : I have one, but normally only take it if I have company. It might be useful to carry on solo trips too, but the likelihood of being rescued by other kayakers is very low, and I\\'m running out of space. radar reflector : It would be good to be more visible to other traffic, but my area is quiet enough that collision is very unlikely. On a kayak, there\\'s a trade-off between reflector height and windage. Further reading can be found in Radar, Reflectors and Sea Kayaks: A Visibility Study by Springuel, Travis and MacDonald. helmet : Most time is spent in deep water; although I enjoy travelling along coastlines, I try to keep clear of the rocks. Could be useful in a forced landing, I guess. mobile telephone : Less use than a VHF, as it only allows one-to-one communication, and only with someone whose contact details you know. Also, would need a subscription to network service, which seems expensive, and the coverage is reportedly very patchy. Possibly useful if you have one already and want to check in with someone on shore regularly - but you could cause unnecessary worry if unable to connect when you\\'re expected to. dry suit : Too uncomfortable (hot) for energetic paddling!',\n",

Firstly (yes another first) wear a good life jacket. I can't say how important both of those points are. If you get caught and especially without a life jacket, you will be very lucky if you get out on your own. You may not be able to control your actions while underwater being tossed around. You won't be able to set up from down, and the water may keep you from being able to control your body parts. If you get stuck on top of one, stay calm and focus on your balance and paddle out of it if able. Otherwise prepare to get tired as you wait for your friends to figure out how to help you and I can't say what help that will be because each situation is different. If you get caught and are underwater then read on. The types of objects that get caught are lighter than water, I.e under normal circumstances they float. The lightest materials get stuck in the center, heavier objects move outward as they get heavier/denser unless they exceed the density of water at which point they get tossed out of the eddy. If you are already underwater, to get out of a washing machine eddy such as from a low head damn, you need to get out of your kayak. That's obviously much easier with a sit-on-top kayak. This reduces your drag. Second is the counter intuitive part. IF and ONLY IF your life jacket is not holding you above water, get out off your life jacket and exhale as much air as you can and pull all your body parts together, and hug your legs. This part is going to be hard, but you need to hold your breath while its exhaled until the eddy drops you since you now are denser than water.\",\n",

Some lakes in southern Sweden apparently do have leeches , which can attach themselves to exposed human skin or, in some cases, to the insides of body cavities. If you were planning to swim in a leech-infested lake (a questionable choice to begin with), I would suggest using swimwear and keeping your head out of the water just in case. Fortunately (for swimmers), leech populations in Scandinavia have declined dramatically over the last century, mainly due to changes in agricultural practices, to the point where they're nowadays all but extinct in Finland and northern Sweden, and fairly rare even in the south. The only other aquatic animals I can think of in Scandinavia that might be harmful to swimmers are pikes , which do occasionally bite humans (usually in the foot), mistaking them for prey. Swimwear won't help you with that, but fortunately it's also a very rare occurrence, and in any case rarely if ever causes any permanent damage. The same goes for other potentially dangerous wildlife that you might occasionally find in or on lakes, such as angry waterfowl defending their young. For those, the best defense is basic common sense: don't get between a baby swan and its mom, don't climb on rocks full of seagull nests, and if something hisses or screeches at you, take the hint and leave it alone. That said, there is at least one somewhat dangerous animal that you should watch out for when going naked outdoors in Scandinavia, although it's not found in water but on dry land: ticks , whose bites can spread Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis . Fortunately, the infection risk is fairly small if the tick is prompty removed, and going swimming presents a good occasion to check your body for any unwanted hitch-hikers that might have attached themselves during the day.\",\n",

How muddy the bank / lake bed is - will you get stuck if you enter or approach the water? I'd personally consider going in after someone just about the last option, and even then only when you've no extra clothing and other ready to aid you leaving the water safely. I believe you can likely be more use from the water edge than in trouble with them, even if its only to grab any wood or such that will float and get it as close to the person as possible to aid in keeping them afloat. Is there ice? If so, the victim may be nowhere near the edge of the lake itself, and you need to consider how much weight that ice can take. What do you have available? Assuming there is ice, anything that can spread your weight is useful, as is anything long. Bear in mind many people find gripping difficult in cold water due to shock, but any floatation device or improvised life aid should work. Best case scenario in my mind is that they pull themselves out the water, either by swimming or by pulling themselves onto the ice and keeping their weight distributed on any ice. At that point you need to go through the steps to increase body core temperature, (by fire, drying clothes, getting out of any wind etc). It's a pretty complicated question to answer, particularly in a short time span, which I'd imagine goes some way to contribute towards the numbers of people killed in bodies of water each year, and those that die trying to save them.\",\n",

If legal and safe to do so, it might be possible to enter the surf from a boundary feature to shorten the paddle (eg: shoreline rocks, groynes, piers and harbour walls). Sometimes you can identify channels in the surf where the wash is not rushing towards the shore. A channel may be calm or could be a rip current flowing seawards. These channels can be exploited to more easily reach the break (though can pose a danger to swimmers lacking surf equipment). Boundary features can cause these conditions, or they can arise naturally at intervals in a long shoreline. Safety Plenty of surf locations are safe but you should weigh the specific risks at each spot. Be aware of: tides and washes, potential currents, the form and composition of the seabed, localism, dangerous sea-life and any safety measures (eg: municipal lifeguards, nets and drum-lines). Consult sources of local information (eg: print/online surf atlases and guides, tourist bureaus, posted notices and other beach-goers). Prefer clean and clear seawater. Dirty and polluted water can result from effluent and river outflows, particularly after rains. Swimming and surfing in this water can cause illnesses and heighten the risk an encounter with a shark (if swollen nearby rivers are capable of carrying dead animals out to sea). Seasonal Changes Seasonal changes of climate and weather might result in sizable and consistent waves only at particular times of the year. The best surf season might not align with the warmest air and water temperatures, requiring a wetsuit and possibly booties/ hood/ gloves.

In this case the grounds are perhaps the size of a salt grain, which may be a lot bigger than the suspended particulates you are talking about. Coffee filters are made of paper, so are biodegradable and quite light, so good for hiking. If these are not good enough, you can get scientific filter papers that are designed to remove a range of particulates, down to the micron range (1000ths of a millimeter), depending on the grade you get. These are not pre-shaped like a coffee filter would be, but are easily folded into a suitable shape. They come in a range of diameters - get as big as you can, you don't want to be wasting your time taking hours to filter enough water for drinking. For my third answer: Investigate flocculants , which are used to provide clean/clear water in situations such as droughts in parts of Africa.\",\n",

Canoes also come in whitewater versions, with a fair amount of rocker, and full bow and stern, and flat water versions that slide like grease over a calm lake. And countless compromises in between.

       "    'body': \"There is one more important technique you can use that I was taught in New Zealand, where you have to cross rivers all the time. If you have a group of people (at least 3), you can greatly enhance safety by forming a chain in the following way: Position the strongest person upstream, the second-strongest person downstream and the weakest person in the middle. Open your hip belts. Every person holds onto the next persons waist by putting their arm between the neighbors back and pack: Start crossing slowly. Keep your boots on for stability and protection from sharp rocks. The line of people you form should be parallel to the flow. That way, the stronger persons at the end of the chain break the strength of the river for the people in the middle while they themselves get supported by the middle people. Cross diagonally, moving across and downstream. That takes much less force than fighting the current. A note on shoes: I was taught to leave them on. Riverbeds are slippery and can have sharp rocks. Your shoes protect you. And once out of the water, the small amount of water in your shoes warms up quickly and forms an insulating layer similar to a wetsuit. Or so they say :) I have done the above in relatively cold water (no ice floating on it, but it was of glacial origin) and didn't suffer frostbite. Image taken from Queenstown Team Building & Group Development . EDIT: I forgot to say that, of course, the first and most important skill when it comes to river crossing is the skill to make the right decision. Rivers can swell quite quickly in rain, but once rain is over, those rivers that flood fast also drop fast. I was held up for a night by a waist-deep side-creek that flooded due to rain, and in the next morning it was only ankle deep. If you are unsure whether you have a good reason to attempt a crossing or not, imagine that your crossing led to a fatality and you have to explain yourself to the grieving family. If you are in a survival situation, you might have a legitimate reason, but any sort of man-made deadline becomes irrelevant. (Wanting to be back in time for Super Bowl, or even wanting to be back in time for work, is not as important as not drowning).\",\n",

If you have alerted the authorities (life guard, police, ambulance, etc.) or can\\'t for some reason then you can try the below. The Royal society for the prevention of accidents (Rospa) has the following advice : Rescuing a drowning person is the last resort and you should do everything possible to avoid getting into a dangerous situation in the first place. If you have to make a rescue attempt, think of your own safety first and never put yourself in danger. If the rescue is too dangerous, wait until the emergency services arrive . Reach With a long stick, a scarf, clothes or anything else. Crouch or lie down to avoid being pulled in. Wade Test the depth with a long stick before wading in and then use the stick to reach out. Hold on to someone else or the bank. Throw A rope is best - you can then pull in the person. Otherwise throw something that will float - a ball, a plastic bottle, a lifebuoy. This will keep the person afloat until help comes. Row Use a boat if there is one nearby and if you can use it safely. Do not try to pull the person on board in case they panic and capsize the boat. So basically do whatever you can to reach the person without entering the water yourself. Many dangerous areas have life rings, etc. These should be your first port of call. If you can\\'t safely get to the person, don\\'t try! This is pretty hard I\\'d imagine but the correct thing to do. To add a brief note to: Let\\'s assume that we see someone is drowning near the lake shore and we\\'re the only person in the immediate vicinity What about your phone? Pretty much everyone has a mobile phone these days. Even if you don\\'t have signal you can often call the emergency services. Mobile phone companies will share bandwidth for emergency calls hence the \"emergency calls only\" message on your phone. So your phone may say it doesn\\'t have signal but it can (often) access signal for a 999(112, 911, etc insert your emergency phone number here ) call.

Each boat style has places they excel at and have shortcomings. Paddle Boat has center paddle (like an old steam paddle boat) that is powered by pedalling. It is only practical on small lakes with little wind. Row Boat there are several variations with the standard beginner model being 8 to 12 feet long and 4 to 5 feet at the beam (wide), with a mostly flat bottom. It is normally powered by one person using two oars, while sitting facing the aft (back) of the boat. It is the most stable of the one to three person paddle powered boats. It can handle rough open water, but is not as maneuverable as some other boats, and the rear facing seating makes a poor choice for rivers with rapids. Kayak a small (usually one person) boat powered by double bladed paddle. The boat of choice for the most extreme water, class 4 rapids and open ocean. There are several style variations. Training and Helmets are suggested for boaters on moving water. Also appropriate for calm water. Gondola Long narrow boat. Powered by a single paddle at the rear. For carrying passengers and/or freight on calm narrow waterways. Limited usage outside of special areas. Canoe Long narrow boat, powered by a single paddle with one blade, from a sitting or kneeling position. Normally holds 2+ passengers and gear. Appropriate for calm to moderately rough or white water. Combined with alcohol and no life jacket often in the news for fatal accidents. PaddleBoard Essentially a surfboard the you can sit or stand on and paddle. Currently popular on calm water. This is more of swimming accessory then a boat. If there are frothy white areas on the water (whitecaps) get back in your car and go home. These can be managed with training and experience but for the novice can be fatal.

Drive away from the city center by the easiest route. When you are past the area of high impact ( no significant damage ) take the long way home.

In congested areas you still make good speed. 7 miles per hour is an easy speed to maintain, so a bridge 30 miles away is an easy 4 or 5 hour ride. If you bike regularly, speeds of 20 miles per hour plus are reasonable, you potentially get home in 4 hours.

I think the following will be applicable to any land form that has been recently glaciated. Rapids and fast current are likely at the following: Any place where a contour line crosses the water course. Any place that is the outlet of a lake. Any place where the water course narrows by a factor of 3. Any place that a small water course goes from double line with shading to a single line in the downstream direction. Any place where an esker crosses a water course. Any place where a water course passes through a notch in a landform. Canoeing, about 1/3 of the above turned out have a visible effect. But I've also seen rapids, sometimes big ones, where none of the above were true. Sometimes they weren't on the map either. All of these are based on notion that faster water takes less room. Lake crossings: Ice continues to contract as it gets cold. While the bottom of the ice is at freezing,the top may be much colder. This can crack the ice through. This is NOT usually a real safety hazard -- you won't fall through. The ice is usually at least 8 inches thick before this happens. But, combined with a snow or wind load, you can get overflow, and end up with a foot of snow, and 6 inches of slush on parts of the lake. This is a real nuisance to deal with. Cracks can also occur earlier in the season from snow loads on thinner ice. The place where streams enter the lake may be thin. If the ice was thick enough to walk on the stream, you're likely safe. I've sometimes seen a wide gravel bar where a stream enters a lake. If the water level is low, you may have fast enough current to have thin ice at this point. Use your ears. You can often hear water moving. Pay attention to the pattern of cold and precipitation in the fall. Heavy snow on bogs can result in the bog not freezing -- net result you have snow on top of soggy peat moss. Can also result in shallow ice on lakes with lots of slush. I've not traveled in Labrador, but have done trips on the east shore of Lake Winnipeg, both summer and winter. It's also Canadian Shield. Very low relief. Topo maps are not a lot of help, as the land's relief is often less than the height of the trees. Lake edges and shapes are the primary set of features used for navigation. I much preferred the photo-mosaic maps, as you could see trees versus rocks versus bogs. My trips were in late December, early January. There was not a problem with thin ice generally. In February you were more likely to have overflow.\",\n",

Other than that the use you will do, and expect of doing in the future, of the kayak will be a big part of your choice: a little calm inland lake and sea will call for two different kayaks. My suggestion to beginners is always to try as many as you can, through renting, dealers demo days, clubs and gatherings. There should be a little bit of homework you need to do about kayak characteristics before going to buy something, learning about the meaning of terms like stability (primary and secondary), tracking, rocker, what is a skeg and what is a rudder and why they are there or not, etc etc. All together they will make you understand a bit how the kayak works and what you want to have or not. It will also help in understanding if a salesman is trying to find something that suits you or something that suits his commission. Generally speaking you have a couple of extremes, on one side there's the performance boat, it's designed to respond readily to the paddler and a beginner will find it very nervous, impossible to have it do what they want. At the opposite side there are some models that are designed to take absolutely everybody in the water, they are not maneuverable at all, the bottom is very flat, difficult to capsize. They cost little but they also do very little for you, they will not improve your skills and they won't offer any room for you to grow. The problem with not improving your skills is that all is good in calm and flat days but sometimes being a better paddler helps in getting out of some uncomfortable situations. It was mentioned that flat bottomed kayaks are more stable, that's true, that's because that shape will always try to follow the water surface. The problem with that is that when you are in waves that same extreme stability works against you as it will tend to follow the surface of the waves. A kayak a bit more unstable, while might seem tippy at first, is less affected by the waves and you will get used to it quickly enough (sometimes you might find yourself in bad weather, even if you have been careful, other times other boats could put you in a difficult situation). Don't pay too much attention to things like speed, what you really want is to look for efficiency. For that same reason, unless you and your wife have the same size, she might like better a kayak slightly smaller than yours. Consider used boats too, the prices are often low for kayaks that are in very good conditions, and at the beginning price is something to consider as there are a lot of other things you need to buy beside the kayak. Older models also have so many reviews online you can get a bit of an idea about them before even trying them (obviously every review is to be taken with a grain of salt). Look for courses in your area, beside learning the basics in a proper and safe way they will clear your ideas on the kind of kayaks around, make you connect with other fellow kayakers, point you towards some good used kayaks. Also take into account your space for storing the kayaks and how to transport them: sometimes one can't get what they want because they don't have enough room. Think about a kayak as a pair of shoes, you cant really have one shoe to do everything,this is the same, there are tons of different models out there, if you start building your own they get even more. As a beginner you might not have a clear idea of how you will use the kayak, a bit because you might expect something different from what you actually get to do, or because you end with friends that steer you towards one activity rather than the other. Give yourself some options, don’t spend thousands right of the bat, try try try PS: if you decide to just learn some things by yourself do it safely.\",\n",

I am not of the opinion that that makes a difference: what\\'s down there (ie, machinery, rock ridge formations, etc), and what\\'s in the water (ie, chemicals) is more important than how deep the water is. In this case, signs should scream \"Danger! Keep Out!\", rather than \"Danger! Deep Water!\" I\\'m also not of the opinion that cold water temps at depths are a reason for the signs, although I do think it might play a role in swimmability, which pertains to your initial question. But experienced swimmers know this, non-swimmers do not. And at depths where temps make a difference to non-swimmers, the depth - and not the temps - is a more troublesome issue for the non-swimmer. Although the question is broad, you did give an example of a lake. In this case, things like currents or animals/fish playing a role in the \"deep\" part of the \"danger\" is less likely. The word \"deep\" doesn\\'t even have legal definition. After all, pools are often labelled \"2 feet deep\", \"12 feet deep\", etc. Is 2 feet really \"deep\"? I think not. So a sign that says \"deep water\" is simply playing to fears, forcing people to be careful. And that is a valid context: to play on fears, as well as to avoid legal liability. For example, you mention a lake. Lakes are not \"x meters deep\"; rather, they have variable depths. Someone who cannot swim, perhaps a child, may walk into a shallow area of a lake, walk around, and suddenly find themselves walking at depths they can no longer walk without having to swim. Is it deep? Yes, for that person, it\\'s too deep for them to walk. Is it deep for a diver? No, of course not - but a diver is used to temperature changes as well as knows how to swim. The signs, therefore, must pertain to those who cannot swim. Further, you see signs at public pools which indicate how deep that part of the pool is - but you never see signs that warn of \"deep water\", even at the 4 meter end. There\\'s a pool near me which has a 20\\' depth for scuba instruction and practice. No signs. Why? Why does a lake with variable depths get signs, while a pool with a known depth not get a sign? And that\\'s the answer: the depths vary, and will be too deep for non-swimmers. The water isn\\'t more or less swimmable at varying depths, it is that it is less walkable at varying depths. And beaches: why do beaches never have signs indicating that water is deep? The depth most definitely varies. There are currents. Temperatures more assuredly change. There are fish, some really nasty ones like sharks and jellyfish. Yet, there are not universally placed signs warning people of these dangers, right? Well, not true: It would take away from the beauty of the beaches to have these signs all over the place; but in fact, they do place signs there. And they do tell you of the dangers: deep water, rip tides, shark sightings, rocks, buoys, and so on. They\\'re just usually not placed right in the middle of the water where one might swim (or walk) into one. And they\\'re very specific about the danger that lurks. As to liability: That there are signs at all is probably to avoid legal liability, but only in limited cases. The reality is that lakes are typically owned by government, and suing a government entity is a herculean task. I think, then, liability is less of the impetus to place a warning sign then it is to help people know that waters are probably deeper than they are tall. In private lakes, perhaps a warning sign has more legal implication, but your question didn\\'t distinguish between private and public bodies of water. Rather, you asked if depth made water more or less swimmable. By the way, the example link you provided struck me as odd (and comical, with very young children playing around a scary looking danger sign). I\\'m from the US, and am wondering if my definition of bathing and paddling are different than in the UK. I\\'m imagining that bathing has a connotation that there is a lot less formality with regards to swimming, and deep water can affect your bathing. A lost bathing suit can be most embarrassing if you can\\'t swim down to retrieve it - but that hardly warrants a \"danger\" sign. As to paddling, well, you\\'re in a boat; the article mentions that swimming and navigation are two separate distinctions in UK law, and that might mean the difference. Paddling, also, is dangerous to swimmers who could become injured by the craft in which you\\'re paddling, or the paddles themselves.',\n",

If you see someone fall through the ice and you can see him, the best thing to do is throw him some rope immediately, while staying as far back away from the whole as possible and pull him out of the hole. Do not let him stand up while he is still close to danger zone, as the ice around the hole may be in itself weak. You need be do your pulling in such a fashion as to spread your weight over the ice: avoid standing if possible. If you cannot see the victim put something with bright colors (red and yellow) at the end of your rope into the water and well below the ice depth. Dot not try going into the water. If the victim sees the rope and grabs it, your in business. Once his head is out of the water and he has had air, get away from the hole and commence the above paragraph. I truly hope none of you will ever have to do this.',\n",

This caused the dea to create much strictness regarding the sale and purchase of iodine. Polar pure has been in negotiations with the dea for approximitly 4 years and we are now happy to say we are back in business with limited restrictions. 1 of the restrictions regarding consumers is that polar pure must be sold directly to consumers which is why we began selling them direct to consumer on amazon.com with an authorized distributor by the dea. The second restriction imposed on consumers is the quantity per purchase. A customer may purchase as many bottles of polar as they see fit however we are only allowed to ship 1 bottle per customer per day. So if a customer purchases 5 bottles of polar pure we would ship 1 each day and the customer would receive 1 each day as well. We apologize for this inconvienance however it is a strict rule enforced by the DEA. Polar Pure uses a unique chemical process that kill All waterborne bacteria up to 99.99999% including viruses. There is no filter on the market that can kill or cleanse water as effectively and as economically as polar pure. Recently a new product was released for sale using only a filter and no chemical solution with the claim that is will kill 99.99% of bacteria but makes no claims regarding Water borne viruses which can cause hepatitis!, this is because water filters cannot filter at the necessary micron level needed to kill viruses. Viruses are about 0.004 microns in size, even the best of filter can only reach 0.2 microns in size.

The handling is much more convenient in the case of PET bottles. Polycarbonate (resin identification code 7) blocks all UVA and UVB rays, and therefore should not be used.

DO NOT cross a river just because you are travelling in a straight line and the river is in the way. A river is a good source of water and, food and materials and they are an excellent guide to navigation as there is a good chance they will eventually lead you somewhere useful. They are also an obvious marker for anybody looking for you. There is also a good chance that if you follow a river you will eventually find a road or path crossing it. If you have a tarp, bivi bag or heavy duty bin bag with you then use that to wrap your pack as well as you can this will both keep your kit dry and help your pack to float. If you have water bottles empty and re close them, they will be useful flotation devices also inflate any plastic bags you have. IF you have rope or cord attach it you an anchor on the 'home' side of the river and your pack this gives you an anchor if you slip and and you can retrieve your pack if you fall and need to drop it. It may also be useful to cut a staff to help you. This should be a reasonably straight and sturdy piece of wood. This will both help you to support your weight as you cross and can also be used to probe the river bed ahead of you for any unseen obstructions such as rocks, sunken logs or holes, all of which are major potential hazards. In general you want to use the staff as a third leg, plant it somewhat downstream of your steps to support yourself against the current. Similarly walk with great care, keeping two firmly planted points of contact (feet of staff) at all times, only transferring your weight forward once you are sure you have a firm footing. Clothing requires some care. Here the compromise is between protecting yourself while you cross and getting your only insulating clothes wet. As a rough guide keep your boots on but remove your socks and keep on any wicking base layers and water proof shells which will dry fast and provide meaningful warmth during the crossing. However in cold conditions you should try to provide yourself with warm, dry clothing to change into as soon as you have completed the crossing. Also if at all possible be prepared light a fire as soon as you have finished the crossing ie find and dry-pack tinder kindling and fuel.\",\n",

Do I get a cold water wetsuit? Something I considered is that if I travelled far enough outside of the city, I could probably hitch a ride, but the traffic might be terrible, or the bridges (if still standing) might be closed due to damage or rubble, thus rerouting traffic very far around (and ultimately away from my home and family).

Knowing the terrain and where the shallows and weak spots are is important. Larger and more turbulent bodies of water take longer to freeze. If you're going to test the ice, use sticks and rocks to simulate concentrated weight and impacts - not yourself. There are some visual cues you can look for - the color of the ice, signs of cracking or slush (or lack-thereof): Clear, blue or green ice might be thick enough to skate on. White ice typ\\xadi\\xadcally has air or snow trapped inside, weak\\xaden\\xading it. Dark ice might be an indi\\xadca\\xadtion that the ice is quite thin—probably too thin for skating.[1] In this case I think local knowledge, or Traditional Ecological Knowledge, gained over time through the science of experience, is very valuable in your search. Your father had a way which worked to tell if the ice is safe, where did he learn that from? Do others in your area have similar methods which could be passed unto you? For example, it sounds like using a weak point on a larger lake as a reference could indicate if the smaller lakes are safe. That could be sensible if the reference point was an over-cautious indicator of the conditions needed for the smaller lakes to be safe. Others may use other indicators - X amount of days below 0 degrees, some combination of temperature and precipitation, etc. but it depends on the location and environmental features. Thus, I'd say your best bet is to refer to local knowledge on what indicators are reliable for your area. [1] http://blog.theclymb.com/tips/8-safety-tips-for-playing-on-frozen-lakes/\",\n",

       "    'body': 'I did a lot of swimming in NW Ontario when I was a kid, and I\\'ve spent more time swimming in lakes and rivers than I have in swimming pools. I find the phrasing of this question curious, because I\\'ve never heard any one use the words \"wild swimming\" nor have I ever considered swimming in a mountain lake or a river \"wild\". None the less, there are some serious considerations when it comes to swimming outside when not swimming at a public beach with a lifeguard: Lakes Factors to consider when swimming in lakes: Size & Depth Temperature Remoteness Debris Size and Depth Small lakes with beaches are the best to play in, they\\'re calm, warm, and very tame. You can pretty much treat such lakes as swimming pools. Larger lakes are where you need to be careful. Bigger lakes are deeper, have bigger wave potential, and can experience more severe weather. When swimming in a big lake, you can stay close to the shore, or choose to wander out into the middle/try to cross the lake. The difference is you can\\'t just get out of the pool if you get tired, get a cramp, or inhale a mouthful of water. If you\\'re out in the middle of a lake, no one is going to come to your rescue, so it would be good for you to learn how do preform a survival float, or drown proofing . Temperature Hypothermia is a real danger when swimming outdoors. Lots of lake swimmers such as triathletes swim in special wetsuits that have great mobility for swimming. Depending on where you are you can find lots of lakes that are warm enough to swim in for long periods of time without getting too cold, and what the temperature is outside with the sun will have an effect on the water as well, but being in the water long enough, especially while moving through the water will slowly cool your core. If you start to get hypothermia in a large open lake, then you\\'re in trouble if you can\\'t get back to shore quick. There is also cold shock , if you\\'ve never experienced swimming in icy waters, cold shock can be a killer, I\\'ve seen lots of kids dive into cold water for the first time where I\\'m from and come up choked for air, frantically flailing their arms, and stumbling to get back out of the water. If you\\'re not prepared for it, and don\\'t have experience with it, cold shock can shut your respiratory system down and really make you panic. Remoteness How remote a lake is obviously affects how quickly you can get help if something goes wrong, but less remote lakes have their own hazards. Unless you\\'re at a public beach that\\'s roped off and has a lifeguard, then your number one concern is often other people , particularly yahoos in speedboats blasting their music, drinking their beers and all looking out the back of the boat at their buddies riding their wakeboards, not paying attention to whomever might be swimming in the water in front of them. Be cautious on lakes where motorboats are present. Debris Heard of drift wood? Well it comes from somewhere, and floating wood in still water is trouble depending on how big it is. Dead heads are trees that have mostly saturated with water and float vertically just below the waters surface. Aside from devestating the hulls and motors of small boats, they can also give you a wicked bonk on the head if you\\'re moving along through the water and make cranial contact with one, so keep your eyes out for what\\'s in front of you, don\\'t just get into your stride and watch the bottom, I have video of swimmers not watching where they\\'re going and head-butting the side of my canoe. You can\\'t even shout at them to warn them of obstacles, because they can\\'t hear you under water. Be alert and aware of your surroundings when you\\'re in the water. Rivers Rivers are far more dangerous to swim in than lakes for obvious reasons. Depending on the size and speed of the water, rivers can generate very powerful currents that can sweep you away, suck you under, bash you against rocks, pin you into a log jam, or throw you off a waterfall. It\\'s important to know what hazards are present in a river before diving in and going for a swim. You also need to learn how to swim in a current. Getting back to shore isn\\'t as simple as aiming for shore and paddling, because you are going to be moving with the current. You have to aim for a location downstream then swim perpendicular to the water\\'s flow in order to reach the side, and try to time yourself so you reach the shore the sametime you\\'re flowing past the point you\\'re aiming for. If you miss your mark, don\\'t try to swim back upstream to get to it, keep swimming perpendicular to the current until you can touch bottom. Swimming against the current is pointless and wears you out fast. Large slow rivers also often have commercial and recreational traffic on them, so once again you need to watch out for boats, as well as weirs (drowning machines) dams, and flood gates. . . . . . I often go out with \"accomplished swimmers\" into lakes and rivers, and they scoff at me when I hand them a lifejacket for a float downstream or playing on windsurfers. It\\'s easy to change their mind about wearing a lifejacket simply by asking them, \"How well do you swim while unconscious?\" In rapid rivers especially, it\\'s sometimes wise to wear a life jacket for the off chance you take a hit to the head by log floating by, or you roll over a rock and get slammed to the bottom. Or an overhanging log clips you in the head while you float by. They also provide extra warmth, padding (for bouncing off rocks when going for a swim in an extra \"wild\" river) and they can help you if you get a cramp while out over deep water. I know it\\'s a pride thing for swimmers, but this is \"wild water\" so maybe consider it for your first couple times out if you\\'re swimming out somewhere exposed or remote.',\n",

The water advances inland faster than you can swim, faster than you can walk, but if I remember correctly, it's a speed that is reasonable to bicycle.

They have a bad reputation, mainly because you get lot's that are really cheap and nasty. Get a decent quality one and its nearly as good on the water as a similar priced 4 piece. I go telescopic as they are so easy to pack and travel with, and when on the water can be folded down very quickly to move around obstacles (trees etc) without getting snagged. If you prefer sectional rods, go 4 rather than 2 piece. Teles are more prone to breakage so treat them gentler than you would a sectional rod, especially when collapsing them down. In the rivers you describe casting distance is not so important, a light rod that can case small lures and soft baits is probably best - length is not everything and a short rod with a good action will be better than a long rod -again, think about the trees and snagging. The exception would be if you live in a very windy location, when you need weight in the lure to get a good cast. Get a decent real with a smooth action. The last couple of seasons I have switched to braid and floro carbon leaders, mostly using small light soft baits. I keep a selection of small spinners and lures as often the trout will take one but not the other. Other gear - a vest with pockets for knifes and lure boxes etc is almost super handy. As is a landing net - ideally a folding one. Best be is find a local shop and talk to them, or a local fishing club.

Sometimes there are rocks and you'll have to stick on one side or the other; otherwise it's better to be on alternate sides to loosen the timing requirements. To switch with a double ended paddle the lead simply pauses for a moment and then switches with the rear following (catching up on the next stroke).

Ive been fishing with fish jumping all around me in those lakes and not so much as had a bite.

Most all lakes in the mountains are stocked with fish, that much is true for the Canadian Rockies at least. The flour actually does more to help the fish in those lakes than it does to hinder them. In mountain lakes fish are primarily preyed upon by raptors, bears, otters, and other critters. In the turbid waters the fish are safely concealed so they can't be spotted by predators.

Beyond that, I think there's a specific point and a more general point. Specifically, deep water is more dangerous in terms of cold water shock . In the first 3-5 minutes after entering cold water there can be a gasp reflex or muscle spasms that might cause intake of water into the lungs. Also, blood pressure and heart rate are raised, which can cause heart problems or stroke. Deep water will remain colder than shallow water. And if the swimmer gets into trouble, they will likely be out of their depth. Also, as has been pointed out in the comments, the banks will often be steep and harder to exit. The accidents tend to happen to young men with a macho approach to cold water. According to RoSPA (The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents): Cold water shock can be prevented by people getting in slowly and acclimatising themselves to the water But many of these young men tend to jump in and swim out 50 metres (150ft). All of a sudden, cold water shock kicks in. It has nothing to do with how strong a swimmer you are - if you look at triathletes, they wear wetsuits to protect themselves against the shock of the water. More generally, it seems that Local Authorities are increasingly taking a US-style legally defensive attitude to any risky activity. Increasingly their reflex is simply to ban swimming to cover themselves. So from this perspective the notice may simply be an excuse for a ban. Here's the response of an official to an Outdoor Swimming Society petition for access to a lake: Only if the Outdoor Swimming Society can strictly control and manage swimming on the lake, including providing and paying for the appropriate signage, safety measures, public liability insurance and cover of lifeguarding facilities all year round - and this council can be satisfied that all the necessary safety precautions are put in place and be indemnified against any incidents that may occur - will the council reconsider its position. Good grief - talk about over the top! This was in a lake where sailing and canoeing were allowed, and the Society was asking why swimming had been singled out. This prejudice against outdoor swimming seems to be an English thing - you don't see it so much in Scotland or the Continent. So what are they going to ban next - sea bathing, perhaps?\",\n",

The key is that ice can support your weight in boots and not yet be safe for dynamic or concentrated loads (i.e. jumping or ice skating). The basic technique is that you first bash the edge of the ice (it is always thinnest at the edge), and look at the thickness underwater. If your bashing put a lot of cracks in the ice or the ice moved on the water, it isn\\'t safe enough to step on. Then you step on the ice -- if it cracks and seems springy, you jump off. Then you jump up and down -- if that\\'s ok, you go out a few feet and look at the ice at slanted angle.

C) the NEOS River Trekker overshoes (voir http://www.neosovershoescanada.com/NEOS-River-Trekker-Overshoes-Non-Insulated-RTK7 ). For options A and B, here is what we can see as the advantages : · It works and tested it in 2011 while in Auyuittuq. · It is ligth (aprox 1kg for the sandals and the sox) · It is very durable (you can’t really perforate them the sox and, if so, you cant repair it easyli with sewing kit). · You can use the sandals as camp shoes. · You can have soft soles with a very good grip in wet rocks. For the disadvantages of options A and B,, · It does not give you a good ankle support. · You have not protection for rocks mowing under water · You spend a fair bit of time to put on and take off. · If you keep them on between nearby rivers to reduce time for taking them off and on, you don’t have ankle support. For option C, here is what we see as the advantages : · You don’t need to take your boots off. · You can really stay dry during crosings . · You can use the overshoes in places where it is really wet to waterproof your boots.. · You ankle support is really good as you keep your boots. · Your boots give you a very good protection for rocks moving under water. · It seems very easy to repair a whole with Aqua Seal in the overshoes . Apparently, it is less durable than the heavy fisher pants but much more than the lighters (500 grammes) and cheaper Light Weight Waders from Wiggy’s http://wiggys.com/moreinfo.cfm?Product_ID=5 . · The soles of the overshoes look good but it is made with a hard material from Vibram (hence the durability) but my experience with Vibram soles are that it does not have such a great grip on wet rocks. For the disadvantages of option C :, · The overshoes are heavier at 2 kg · They are 36’’ high and thus go at the higher part of the thighs and, except if you manage to add a good seal such as by attaching to it a drysuit neck gasket, water can get inside if you misstep or you must go into deeper water even without current. If so, you can quickly be in big trouble and go down. Option C looks great. It may even be too good to be true. However, I find it surprising that no one talk about these overshoes for Auyuittuq. I am mostly worry about that last disadvantages and the hard sole grip. Most reviews come from hunters in Alaska and they may not have crossings with a lot of current. If you got time, I would really like to hear your views on these 3 options. Thanks\",\n",

No sense in getting wet or risking anything if there is an easier, or proper crossing, a few hundred yards up or downstream. The other first step is to make sure you are all safe when you cross. Bring a strong rope that is long enough to span the river, or to at least span to a spot midway where you can take a break. A hundred foot rope strong enough for this purpose should be fine for most typical back country adventures. You can then tie the rope securely to the first person crossing, and hang on to that as a safety device in case the crosser wipes out and loses control. Learn the proper techniques for the ad-hoc harness. The rope also comes in very handy in hauling backpacks or other gear across the river. Once someone makes it across. If the river is not violent, and the danger of falling in is simply that you get wet, have to swim to the other side, then bushwhack through some dense mosquito infested brush to get back to the trail, then you should not use the rope. Use the rope where the danger of falling into the drink is very serious, e.g. a waterfall is not far ahead. As for where to cross, I disagree with Aaron's answer to target a deeper spot. Shallower is better*. Deeper being slower depends on the width of the stream being constant, which isn't always true. Additionally, the force you feel in a deeper section will be greater, and will be higher up on your body, making it more difficult for you to balance. If it's shallower, and you can see the bottom, you're pretty much in the clear as long as you don't rush yourself. When you cross, walk across, slowly and carefully. Contrary to Aaron's answer, don't swim across, walk. You can put your feet down. However, the dangers of getting a foot stuck, as he mentions, are very real and very serious. If you maintain your balance as you walk across, you will be fine. If you lose your balance, immediately pull your feet up, and position yourself flat on your back with your feet in front of you, up high. If the river is violent, your friends can haul you in using the rope. If the river is gentle but strong, then float down in the described position, and paddle yourself to one side or the other, and get out. There is no real technique as far as I am aware, just doggy paddle. Resist the temptation to try and put your feet down to stop you from floating downriver. If the river is deep and fast-moving enough to make this whole ordeal concerning, it is fast enough that if your foot gets stuck you will not be coming back up alive. Afterwards, collect all your gear, dry yourself off, and continue onward. *This answer based on the assumption that the river is not very deep, and where 'shallow' is not any deeper than waist height.\",\n",

Foot Entrapment Any time you are in water moving at over 2 kts [about 3.7km/h] if you get a foot trapped [in a rock, branch or what ever] and the water is deeper that your finger tips to your nose [think push-up position] you will drown unless you can get your foot free. Hydraulics Faster flowing water has additional hazards. submerged rocks, and out cropping of shore may cause \"Hydraulics\", \"Eddy Currents\" and other invisible currents, if you do not have a good understanding of what to look for you may be unable to get to the shore, even in a small creek, or you may get sucked into a \"hole\" a churning current which can trap you in a vertical loop, letting you surface for just a second before dragging you along the bottom of the river, and repeating this until you get free or drown. Sweepers When a tree has fallen into, or over a stream or river bank in such a manner its in somewhat perpendicular with the water, this is called a sweeper. If a swimmer gets entangled with a sweeper it can \"sweep\" you down and the water pins you to the tree or its branches, the most dangerous sweepers are fallen trees with many limbs, which can make it harder to self rescue. There are many more hazards to moving water, I am by no means an expert, but even when the water is moving more slowly [in a pool, under a waterfall etc] many people die due to bad judgment. these pools look quite deep in relation to the rapids, but may be much shallower than they look. A swan dive into a rock, usually results in a broken neck, quickly followed by drowning. [near Vancouver Canada, I would estimate we lose upwards of 10 people every year, just on about 5 waterfalls] Stay safe, and don\\'t swim in rivers alone, or with out some understanding of the risks you may be taking. talking to locals helps, but its often the locals who drown, so treat there advice with caution.',\n",

Moreover, the definitions aren't very helpful. From The Oxford English Dictionary , a cascade is: Usually, a small waterfall; esp. one of a series of small falls, formed by water in its descent over rocks, or in the artificial works of the kind introduced in landscape gardening. And from the OED , a waterfall is: A cascade of water falling from a height, formed when a river or stream flows over a precipice or ledge; (also) a garden water feature resembling this. Much of my hiking has been done in the Sierra, especially Yosemite, where waterfalls and cascades of every size abound. I have always thought of a waterfall as water that flows over a lip and then falls freely. And a cascade as water that may flow quite steeply downhill but remains in contact with the underlying rock or streambed. I would never describe Nevada Falls, for example as a cascade, nor would I describe the cascades that flow over the bare granite at roughly the 8,000 foot level of Yosemite Creek as waterfalls. Is there a difference between the two in TGO in other parts of the world, or have I made up a distinction that is not commonly used in TGO?\",\n",

To Contrast here is huka falls, a waterfall that even hundreds of meters upstream you cannot safely cross because of the heavy currents and lack of exit points from the river. In general you should avoid any water crossing with any meaningful current; unless you have whitewater experience or you can maintain your footing, shin deep or less, the entire time. In an emergency type scenario ropes can be helpful to mitigate risks, but require careful application as they add complexity to a potentially dangerous situation. Again experience goes a long way.

It\\'s not clear if you want to or need to do a out and back, or if you can spot a car and do a traverse. Here are just a few options that come to mind without looking things up on a map: From the end of Sawyer River Road in Crawford Notch, hike up Carrigain one day, stay the night, and back down the next. There can be some good views, although I don\\'t remember now if the old fire tower on top has been taken down or not. There are great views from there if it\\'s still there. This is fairly easy for the alloted time. You can arrive in afternoon on the first day without it causing a problem. I don\\'t know about waterfalls, but there will be some stream crossings before you get onto Signal Ridge. Take the Ethan Pond Trail from Crawford Notch to Thoreau Falls. From there you can go down by the falls, south, then west, then north again over Bondcliff, Bond, Guyot, Zealand, past Zealand Falls Hut, and back to Crawford Notch. This is quite ambitious, but doable if you start early in the morning and are in good shape and willing to do a lot of hiking for the alloted time. You\\'d probably spend the night partway up Bondcliff. The upside is you go by several falls, and the top of Bondcliff is probably the most spectacular place to stand in the White Mountains. I screwed up once and ended up spending the night on Bondcliff. I don\\'t recommend that. Plan better than I did. If this still isn\\'t enough of a challenge, you take the Zeacliff trail \"shortcut\" down from Zealand Mt instead of going by the hut. I did that once too, and decided it should be a up-only trail, so I also don\\'t recommend that. Go to some of the waterfalls on the west side of Crawford Notch, but keep going instead of back to the parking lot like everyone else. There are ways to loop around and come out a different place in Crawford Notch. There should be at least a couple of choices here you can find by studying a map. I don\\'t have one in front of me, so can\\'t say much more about this off the top of my head. There are various options for one-night backpacks in the Carter-Moriah range east of Pinkham Notch. For example, start going up the Nineteen Mile Brook Trail, then pick a way that loops back to the road eventually. There should be three basic choices, with the southern one including Carter Dome. There are lots more possibilities. Get a map and look. However, one thing you probably don\\'t want to do is Franconia Ridge. There are some pretty waterfalls on the Falling Waters trail, but there are no good places to camp on top. Either it\\'s above tree line or within a exclusion zone, pretty much all the way from Liberty to Garfield. This is also the most crowded backcountry area in the White Mountains because of the number of trails providing access from Franconia Notch, and the presence of Greenleaf Hut. If you\\'re looking for a ambitious but certainly doable day hike, then this works better. One possibility is up Falling Waters, north along the ridge over Lincoln, to LaFayette, down to the hut, and back to the same parking lot via the Bridle Path. You get great views for quite a ways along Franconia Ridge, which is above treeline from Haystack to just above the hut on this route. If you do this, bring winter clothes in your pack. You won\\'t need crampons in the summer, but a good rain/wind shell, wind pants, extra wool sweater to put under the rain shell, goggles, and gloves is NOT overdoing it. The weather can change there very quickly on short notice. I\\'ve started out in shorts and a T shirt from Liberty Springs in the morning, and was wearing full winter gear except for crampons by the time I got to LaFayette. At that time 20 mile/hour sleet was blowing in my face, and I was very glad to have goggles on. This was in August.

Lebannon Hills Regional Park is a personal favorite of mine, and a hike around all the lakes within the park will be a solid day hike. Otherwise, most of the best unpaved trails out there-at least the ones that are upwards to two hours way-are going to be located North of Minnesota. The Lake Superior trail tends to divide itself into multiple pathways allowing you to either take a light easy hike or a more moderately intensive hike. If you are fine with some smaller trails as well, I would recommend taking some time traveling a bit north of Duluth to take a short walk around Silver Creek Cliff and Fifth Falls located at Goosebury Falls. Both are pretty short hikes, but both are worth the trip! They are not very well known compared to the main waterfall area in Goosebury falls, so they do not get visited by very many people. A little closer away to the Twin Cities is the Ice Age Trail , in St. Croix Falls. The total trail is 1,200 miles, stretching all the way through Wisconsin.

The two main things you don't want to have upstream from your drinking spot are still water, which is a breeding ground for insects and insect borne diseases, and feces, which can be dropped anywhere but is less likely to be present the smaller the creek is. If you can follow a stream to its source coming out of a mountainside you're golden, this water was filtered by the soil and is usually very clean. But you have to try and be realistic in looking for it. Going uphill costs a lot of energy. And when you're lost and looking for civilization in particular you often want to be heading down to the valley. Rain water is also very clean, clouds are relatively bacterium free. The problem with rain is collecting it. Even in the wettest of torrents leaving a glass out for a day nets you just one glass of water. Normal rainfall is more like a few millimeters to a few centimeters. You'll have to use tarps and such to collect rainfall from as large an area as possible. Snow and even glacier ice are often relatively unsoiled as well, being rain water that has been sitting on the ground surrounded by itself. But you want to melt and drink it rather than eating it, that will cost you too much body heat. In very cold conditions melting can be tricky, requiring fire or alternatively a shelter being warmed by body heat and lots of patience. In some places you can dig for water, most notably the deepest parts of dry riverbeds and the lowest points of dune landscapes near the sea. (Not on the beach, the ground water is salt there.) How clean it is depends on local conditions. While this water has been somewhat filtered by the soil it also sits relatively still in a place where gravity slowly collects pollution and such. The more deserted the landscape the better. And then there is the possibility to go for a dirty water source, or even green leaves, and making drinking water using a solar still. Describing how to make one is a bit out of scope for this answer, but it's relatively easy provided you have some form of a clear plastic sheet available and the sun shines. The amount of water it brings you is pretty small though, and especially when you're on the move a readily drinkable source is preferable. There's also the option to build a filter by taking something like a bucket, making a small hole in the bottom and filling it with layers of sand, rocks and if you have it charcoal (from your campfire). It's not as good as the dozens of meters of clean soil on top of a natural spring, and it's not as clean as a solar still, but it's something, and it's relatively fast.\",\n",

A small pothole full of water on the trail can be completely filled with a couple of handfuls of gravel. Expand this to a small pond at a park and have daily visitors tossing gravel from the path in to the pond, and soon the pond is gone ( the path will need fresh gravel as well ). In any case, a pond exists because moving water encounters a depression, the water slows and deposits sediments, these sediments eventually fill the depression, and in a few tens to thousands of years the pond is gone. Niagara Falls is a large waterfall, the erosion is significant, and if a few visitors a day toss a pebble from the path into the falls, the impact is negligible. In another 23,000 years the falls will be gone. Niagara Falls has moved back seven miles in 12,500 years and may be the fastest moving waterfalls in the world.

The smaller they are, the harder it is to find an easy way to remove them effectively. For both of the following you will need to take a funnel to hold the filter. However, the simple answer is a coffee filter - these are single use paper filters that are designed to take the fine grounds used for filter drip coffee (common in the US and Canada, not so much elsewhere...). In this case the grounds are perhaps the size of a salt grain, which may be a lot bigger than the suspended particulates you are talking about. Coffee filters are made of paper, so are biodegradable and quite light, so good for hiking. If these are not good enough, you can get scientific filter papers that are designed to remove a range of particulates, down to the micron range (1000ths of a millimeter), depending on the grade you get. These are not pre-shaped like a coffee filter would be, but are easily folded into a suitable shape. They come in a range of diameters - get as big as you can, you don't want to be wasting your time taking hours to filter enough water for drinking. For my third answer: Investigate flocculants , which are used to provide clean/clear water in situations such as droughts in parts of Africa.\",\n",

If you have a group of people, interlock arms and walk across together with the line of the group being parallel to the stream. This gives each person stability up/down stream, which is the direction you are more likely to fall due to the push of the water. To cross alone, use a long pole that you can stick into the ground downstream from you. You and the pole become a triangle such that you can lean on the pole to offset the downstream push of the water. Move only one of your feet or the pole at one time. That all said, sometimes you can\\'t cross. Many years ago, I was on the North Cascades and had gotten dropped off at a trailhead. The plan was to hike over a mountain range and back to camp on the other side, something like 10-12 miles if I remember right. There was a sign near the trailhead saying that the \"Panther Creek bridge was out\". It was a nice summer day, so I figured I\\'ll just get a bit wet. When I got to Panther Creek, I found it was a lot more than what we call a \"creek\" around here. It was a swift flowing small river, probably 5 feet deep or so in the middle and maybe 50 feet across. I tried to ford it, but it got too dangerous, and I could see once I got swept off my feet I\\'d be carried quite a ways downstream before I could eventually make it to one bank or the other and grab hold of something. It was a long walk back to camp along the road. As a side note, on the long hike back to camp along the road, there were several scenic turnouts. At one such turnout a crowd of people had gathered around a car. When I got closer, I could see they were all listening to the radio in that car, which had been turned up loudly for the purpose.

       "    'body': \"Yes Charlie's answer is excellent, but to append some technical information from my background as a civil engineer may be helpful. When evaluating stormwater impacts for a site, there's generally 3 key criteria: runoff rate, water quality, and groundwater recharge. Runoff rate is what it sounds like and is a function of the time of concentration, which refers to how long it takes a drop of water to travel from the most hydraulically distant point in a watershed (meaning what takes the most time) to some common low point (i.e. an inlet, a river, or some other receiving water body). The time of concentration is heavily impacted by the surface condition that the water passes over. Moving through thick grasses means that a drop of water has to keep changing it's path and thus has a longer time of concentration. Conversely, were water passing over an area of bare ground without any grass or other vegetation (such as after a fire), it will move much more quickly. The time difference can be drastic, some sites I've worked to develop have had the time of concentration reduced from 45 minutes to just 6 minutes; this means that water is hitting the receiving water body much faster than normal and thus causing much higher peak flows unless we design control basins to delay that flow. The next criteria, water quality, is obviously impacted as you've demonstrated with your picture of a waterfall running black. Typically, water quality is improved by letting it infiltrate into the ground, slowing it down to permit sediment and fines to settle out, or some other method, but none of those techniques are available when water's moving fast with a high sediment load, hence, waterfalls that smell like extinguished campfires. The last criteria, groundwater recharge, also suffers for most of the same reasons that the other two do: The water is just moving too fast to practically infiltrate into the ground. It's possible that the charcoal fines are impact the soil media to make it less permeable, especially if aspects of the fire 'compact' the fines into the media, such as vaporizing into the soil media and condensing therein as described in Charlie's answer. In addition to all these issues, the reduced time of concentration means that the moving water has a lot of energy, which will increase the likelihood of ruts and gullies forming.\",\n",

When approaching the highest part, it becomes apparent there is still substantial snow: Above Vale do Conde. However, that is not the worst problem. It was a warm and sunny day when I was there. I believe the stream in Vale do Conde is normally ankle-deep and easily crossed. When I was there, the entire valley was flooded with meltwater. Worse, I had not prepared for river-crossings, and had brought neither stream-crossing footwear, nor my fording pole. I tried to ford barefeet, but turned around when I reached the actual bank after 5 metre of knee-deeping wading through the flooded part, only realising the actual stream had become waist-deep. The aborted attempt resulted in many thorns in my bare feet, ouch. Spring flood in Vale do Conde, forcing a detour. Instead, I ploughed through the snow upstream, hoping to find a way to cross. Eventually I found a rock lying over the stream, that I could scramble across. I did sink through the snow, so perhaps snowshoes would have been helpful here, but the snow was intermittent so I'd have had to take them on and off frequently. Snow at the detour in Vale do Conde. Back on the trail, the trail was alternately covered in deep snow, or covered in meltwater. In this case the meltwater was shallow enough to walk through with my boots without getting my feet wet. Above Vale do Conde, back on the trail, the trail is very wet. Viewing the highest mountain, Torre , in the distance, I could tell that there was a lot more snow yet to come. View to Torre, the highest parts of the Serra de Estrela, where people are still skiing (nearly 2000 metre elevation). Due to delays, I reached no further than Covão dos Conches this day, and camped there illegally, as I was unable to reach the campground at Covão d'Amatade which was another 2–4 hours of hiking away (probably less than 2 in good conditions, but the steep trail down was tricky when I hiked it in heavy rain and half covered in snow). The reward: Covão dos Conches, entrance to Middle Earth? The following morning, the weather was poor. This was the stretch where snowshoes would have been most useful, as I walked through the snow continuously for a couple of hours. However, it was entirely passable without snowshoes.

Depending on the intensity of the flow, you may want to start upstream of where you want to be on the bank on the other side, and back step a little with each side step making your way to your landing at an angle, it's a lot easier to work with the current than it is to fight it. You can use the rocks in the water to help you with your footing, feel for them with your feet as you shuffle them to the side, and plant your foot in front of rocks that feel steady with you heel on the rock. Take small controlled steps so you don't lose your balance, and don't pick your feet up higher than you have to. Step too high or too far and the current is going to take your foot away. I always keep my arms out and in front of me and keep my knees bent for balance, the force of the water is strong, and it doesn't take much to get thrown off, so take your time and don't rush things.

If the creek is high enough or fast enough to look dangerous, I try to discipline myself to spend a significant amount of time searching around for the safest place to cross. The safest point may be 100 yards away from where the trail hits the creek, and may be invisible from the trail. The safest point is usually the widest, because the water flows most slowly there. Sometimes in 10 minutes of searching you can find a tree or rocks to get across without wading at all, or you'll see another hiker who will tell you a better place to cross. Unclip belly band and pectoral strap so that if I fall, I won't be trapped by my pack. Make sure sleeping bag, down jacket, etc., are inside a trash bag or something. I usually hike in running shoes. To cross a stream, I take off my socks and remove the inserts from the shoes, then put the shoes back on to protect my feet while crossing. Although river rocks are mostly smooth, a foot injury could ruin my whole trip, so I don't want to cross barefoot. While crossing, rehearse what you have to do if you get swept off your feet. If this happens, shrug off your pack. The big risks of death are head injuries and getting trapped underwater. To reduce the chance of a head injury, try to orient yourself so you're going feet first. After crossing, hike 10 minutes and then put the socks and inserts back in the shoes.

Any source of water - no matter how large or small - should be avoided when choosing a camp site. 100 meters is just a guideline, 200 meters is better. 200 meters and out of sight is great. The reasons are several-fold: Waste - wastewater should never be put in creeks/lakes/etc - and although many people will walk 200 meters away to dispose of it properly, most wont. The closer people are to a body of water, the more likely they are to say \"ah to heck with it\" and dump it in. It\\'s difficult to resist the temptation to just do a quick rinse of hands, plates, etc in a creek that is right next to you. Erosion - The riparian areas next to creeks and lakes are often the most sensitive, and can not handle large amounts of traffic. Traffic up and down and along the creek banks can cause rapid erosion of soil and cause vegetation loss. This is a problem from alpine to canyon ecosystems. Visual Disturbance to other hikers - Setting up your tent beside that beautiful pristine lake is an awesome scene, right up until that group across the lake sets their tent up in your view. Don\\'t be \\'that guy.\\' I\\'ve successfully distributed 15 groups of backpackers around a high-alpine lake so that every single one of them could pretend they were the only ones out there.

These are also natural travel corridors. Your presence can be disruptive to the fauna, or could put you in the path of grumpy wildlife (bears). These reasons apply to all ecosystems (apline, desert, grassland, etc) and as such, camping away from water sources is good \\'Leave No Trace\\' practice in all situations.',\n",

Second, for above timberline: Walk upstream past several confluences of minor streams with the main stream and eventually the main stream will be crossable.

On a day hike, never cross a barely crossable snow-melt stream in the morning unless you know of a much easier place to re-cross it in the afternoon.

In many locations most of these dangers won\\'t factor in, but they\\'re useful things to bear in mind if you\\'re trying to assess the danger of a particular body of water. I\\'ll focus on the sea here - for other things such as rivers similar things apply (but there\\'s obviously other things to look out for, different kinds of wildlife, waterfalls, etc.) Currents : Yes, there are areas of sea that can \"pull you in\". (The same obviously applies for rivers here, but this is less commonly thought of with the sea.) More dangerously, there are also currents that can \"pull you under\". Similarly, and sometimes just as dangerously, there are areas of the sea that can \"pull you along\" the coast horizontally. This can sometimes be dangerous simply because it\\'s much easier to miss, and can pull you into dangerous areas such as: River outflows : Along the same guise as currents, but these can often hide at full tide and seem to appear very suddenly and strongly if you move into them. Quicksand : Not often thought of when you\\'re in the water, but if you decide to stay on the bottom for a while and hit a patch of this, it can root you to the spot. Watercraft : Again, something that\\'s often missed, but stray jetskis (for example) can seriously injure or kill you if they hit you full on. Hidden depth : While you can often expect beaches to fall down at a gentle angle, there are often hidden areas that can suddenly drop away. While not an inherent problem if you\\'re a good swimmer, these can often be associated with undercurrents too - so beware. Personally I\\'ll only swim on beaches I\\'m familiar with at high tide (and have seen at low tide) to try and mitigate this somewhat. Wildlife : This varies greatly - some areas can have deadly sharks (or similar) in them, and these risks go without saying! However, bear in mind more common things such as jellyfish (some of which will just give you a nasty sting and others that can be lethal) and crabs (which will give you a nasty nip if feeling threatened.) Know what lives in the waters you\\'re swimming in, and be prepared accordingly. Sharp rocks : This goes hand in hand with wildlife in that sharp limpets can also live on rocks, making matters worse - but just because the entrance into the water looks sandy, doesn\\'t mean it is all the way through. If you swim at high tide and stay in while the sea recedes, you may find yourself painfully clamouring over all types of nasties. Same goes if an unexpected large wave throws you against such rocks. Pollution : Like any body of water, you should be aware of pollution - especially after storms many runoffs will quickly head into the sea containing a variety of toxins and bacteria. In some countries / areas factories are still permitted to dump waste into the sea directly, in this case I wouldn\\'t even risk getting in the water!',\n",

It starts somewhere deep in the Andes in the Mantaro River , which has a very steep gradient - 5 m/km, meaning that it will have rapids/white water, it then descends through a range of river systems into lowland forest and finally out into the Atlantic Ocean. It has a wide range of biomes from untouched forest, to alpine zones, to big cities to a delta. This means there are a huge range of places that you could potentially swim - how safe each of those is, is very very dependent on where it is. Generally lowland rivers will be relatively safe to swim in (assuming no flooding and a competent swimmer), so long as the swimmer stays aware of hazards in the water - tangling vines/roots, floating or submerged branches/trees, rocks, eddies etc. Swimming downstream of industrialized cities and high intensity agriculture is relatively risky in terms of infection from bacteria and other pathogens, as well as pollution, but the risks are fairly low still, unless you ingest the water or have open wounds that could get infected. There are guided tours on the Amazon to see things like the Amazon River Dolphin , some of which apparently will let people swim with them .

You can tour the rain forest along the coast, and can drive to the top of Mt Olympus. The North Cascades are \"just\" another bunch of pretty mountains with nothing particularly outstanding. Much of what you can drive thru isn\\'t even in the actual park. If I remember right (it\\'s been a long time, and things could have changed too), the main campground at Ross Lake isn\\'t even in the park. If you want to go hiking thru the back country, the North Cascades have a lot to offer. I remember hiking up one of the local peaks with a lookout on top, and didn\\'t encounter another hiker on the 10 mile or so round trip. However, the vast majority of visitors don\\'t come to a these parks for that. They want to drive thru some spectacular scenery with the kids and grandma, maybe participate in a ranger-led program, and roast marshmallows over the campfire in the evening. Mt Ranier and Olympic simply have more to offer in that regard.',\n",

In a spot where you see several lines merge together, that is a sheer drop-off. Avoid those, obviously. Look for nesting Vs on the map. These are ridges, or possibly ravines. Water (blue) bisecting the V will tell you it is a valley. Through practice, I can pretty distinguish a ravine from a ridge in a few seconds. Sorry, I can’t describe a technique for that. * Perhaps I am recommending spending time poring over contour maps ;—) Be aware of the scale of the map and the level of elevation change for the map. In America, the USGS topographical maps generally go with 20’ per contour line. Some use 6m, but the style is distinct. We also have some maps with 40’ contours done in the same style as the 20’. Read carefully. My brain is trained to see that style of map and see 20’ contours. I have gotten myself into some difficulty expecting the terrain to be not so bad, but finding it quite steep in 3-D. Also, realize that because of the nature of maps, there can be an awful lot of terrain variety hiding between two contour lines. The scree slopes you mentioned will be quite irregular. * Having thought this over, if you are planning an off-trail hike, definitely spend some time studying the contour maps.

Sweat can evaporate straight off of you before you can even see it, and people don't always realize how much fluid they've lost. Replace electrolytes, not just the water. You'll probably drink more water than you're accustomed to, which can lead to hyponatremia . Start out at first light, and plan to be back before 10. The middle of the day is brutal. It's steep . Plan twice as much time to get back as it took you to get down. In other words, if you start your hike at 6 a.m., turn around at 7:20. It's difficult to do because you'll still have energy, but trust me, you'll need it for the climb out. If you opt for an afternoon hike, keep in mind that the desert can get deceptively cold after sunset. People die of hypothermia, even in the summer. Don't go in the summer if you can help it. May and September are the best months. The South rim is the easiest to reach, and the trails into the canyon are better traveled and have more water sources, but that makes it more crowded with tourists. The North rim takes a couple extra hours to get to, but it is significantly cooler, less crowded, and has more trees for shade. I highly recommend it for hikes along the rim.\",\n",

Even just having them yell at you not to try to stand in the middle of the stream could save lives, in the worst case scenario. Don't paddle them as a multi day run away from easy river acces, like in a gorge. I have no idea what you're planning, but if it sounds like an expedition and looks like an expedition, get a little experience first. Don't go out without safety equipment. Have a helmet, floatation device (life vest, but specifically one for kayaking and rafting, not a sailing vest if at all possible), wetsuit or drysuit, plus at least one first aid kit among the group and a throw line for anyone that can use it, depending on the type of water (they're not equally useful on all kinds of rivers, and at level 2 that can mean they're not necessary).

Boulders in boulder fields can readjust and reset after the winter and may be unstable. The snow melt can run out underneath the snow, leaving large tunnels open that may or may not hold your weight. This especially applies to snow bridges over streams. Melting snow will slow you down, making travel times longer.

Here's what I recommend: Take Interstate 90 across South Dakota (or go up through Wisconsin/North Dakota, then drop - much more scenic in Minnesota/Wisconsin, and easier driving in ND than SD) until you go through Gillette, Wyoming. Visit Devil's Tower National Monument , America's first national monument on the way. Keep going until you arrive in Buffalo, staying on the interstate when it heads north until you reach Sheridan, Wyoming. Keep going another 20 miles on the interstate, past Sheridan, exit the interstate (Exit 9 ) for Ranchester/Dayton, Wyoming, and take Highway 14 across the Bighorn Mountains (very lush & green on the east side) which takes you through Bighorn National Forest . Immediately after Burgess Junction (smack dab on top of the Bighorns ~10,000 ft elevation), - Highway 14 splits into 14 and 14A - take 14A, as it is the prettier way to Lovell , Powell , and finally, Cody, Wyoming . side note: If you're interested in camping instead of hotels, consider camping on the Bighorns, it gets perfectly cool at night and the campgrounds are usually very uncrowded. Camp at Porcupine Campground and if you have time for a short 1-mile roundtrip hike, try hiking to the gorgeous Porcupine Falls. Also, when in the Bighorns, look for moose, it is common to see at least one to four moose every time you cross! Lovell is the first town you'll encounter after getting off the Bighorn Mountains. Visit the Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area (very close to Lovell - highly recommend, a hidden jewel) as well as the park Visitor Center in Lovell - very helpful staff!), which features the biggest canyon in the Northern Rockies (over 1,000 feet deep), bighorn sheep, wild horses on the Pryor Mountain Wild Horse Range (first wild horse preserve in the nation), as well as a scenic drive, boating, camping, beautiful hikes, archaeology, and other activities. It even has a lake with a small beach. This park straddles Wyoming & Montana, but the road doesn't go all the way through, so it is a perfect short drive north and back (~1-1.5 hours round trip), and another great place to stop for the night. Consider visiting the (brand new facility in Fall 2011) Heart Mountain Interpretive Learning Center between Cody & Powell, a facility located at the old site for the Heart Mountain Relocation Camp, one of ten internment camps for incarcerating Japanese Americans during World War II. Next stop is Cody, Wyoming - the town founded by Buffalo Bill, the Rodeo Capital of the World, and the gateway to Yellowstone National Park. Cody is full of tourist attractions, a number of hotels/motels, the world famous Cody Nite Rodeo (every night from June through August), the large Buffalo Bill Historical Center (five museums under one roof - including a 5,000+ gun collection, Natural History, Art, and others), and other things. Yellowstone's East Gate is just an hour's drive west from Cody, you'll pass through Buffalo Bill State Park (a large reservoir on the western side of Cody) on the way, as well as pass through the pretty Shoshone National Forest . Overall: be BEAR-aware - most campgrounds have metal lockers to keep your food secure and safe - don't store it in your vehicle or tent. See this question for more info on dealing with bears: What precautions should I take to protect myself and my camp from bears? . Relax! When on vacation, don't try to keep to a strict schedule. Instead, feel free to take your time and really enjoy the scenery. Take LOTS of PHOTOS! You won't regret it. Guaranteed. Make sure you have plenty of batteries/SD cards/memory for your camera(s). Also pack some binoculars. You may want to purchase an annual Parks Pass if you plan on visiting more than one or two national parks. Have fun!

I know this question is about if you \"have\" to cross it, but bear in mind that falling in is a real danger and if you do, hypothermia can onset very quickly and be deadly. It depends on the situation - if we\\'re talking about a shallow, wade-able body of water that\\'s not much more than a stream I\\'d be much less hesitant to give it the go-ahead than if we\\'re talking about something 20ft deep and triple that in width! Sometimes your gut reaction can be good here, if you think it looks highly risky and you might not make it successfully, don\\'t attempt it! And if you can\\'t swim strongly and you\\'re just relying on trying to balance on top of a few logs without falling in, don\\'t even think about it. If you decide you to cross it: Look for a bridge - No, seriously. Some people really can miss the obvious. Prepare - Be sure to prepare thoroughly first. Re-pack your rucksack so all the vitals you\\'ll need are kept as dry as they can be, and accessible (you\\'ll want things like chemical heating packs, stoves, fire fuel and dry, warm clothes to all be very handy when you reach the other side.) Find a good point to cross - As a general rule avoid deep, fast flowing water. It\\'s better to find somewhere that might be a bit wider, but shallower and easier overall. If the river narrows at a particular point don\\'t be fooled, the water has to have gone somewhere and unless it\\'s branched off to another stream, it\\'s because it\\'s gone down - i.e. it\\'s deeper! Wider patches are generally shallower, slower flowing and therefore a better choice even if it seems like you\\'ve got more of a task ahead of you to cross. There are also other telltale signs you can look out for - reeds for instance tend to thrive better in shallower water. Find a good time to cross - Leave yourself plenty of time before it gets dark - it may take longer than you think, and you don\\'t want a lack of light providing an unnecessary complication. I\\'d advise crossing late morning if you can at all - that way you ensure you get plenty of light which crosses one of the list of things to worry about (and it\\'s an easy one to cross off) and you also ensure that you get to the other side when the day, on average, should be warmest. If anyone\\'s fallen in or got wet, you\\'ll be glad of every little bit of heat you can get to warm you back up! Stay out of the water if you can - See if there are any materials around which you could use to construct a raft or similar. The best thing to avoid getting frozen solid is to stay out of the water in the first place. Equally, try and see if you could build a bridge with logs or any other suitable material. Rope yourself to a secure point on the bank..? - This is a contentious one. I initially recommended it because the plus side is that you won\\'t get swept away in a current, the minus side is that it could get caught or pull you under. Judge the situation accordingly, but if you do use it, use a quick release karabiner to attach it to yourself (so you can remove it quickly and easily if you have to.) As soon as you\\'re across, get the heating supplies out - It may well be that adrenaline is keeping you going and you\\'re colder than you think. Equally even if you feel ok, the next person of your team to cross may not be. Make the most of this by getting a fire going if you can, get warm clothes out, and keep an eye out for each other to make sure everyone\\'s ok.

While it is true that there are less hikers in early June than later in the summer, there are reasons for this. Black flies can be quite annoying then. June is also wetter and muddier than early September. Avoid Labor Day weekend, but there will be fewer hikers immediately after that. September weather tends to be dryer with more clear days than other parts of the summer. Personally, my favorite time to hike in the White Mountains is from Labor Day until peak leaf season. That's in early to mid October, depending on elevation and weather specifics of that year. Timing isn't the only way to avoid crowds. Most of the people will be on the AT, or doing day hikes on a few of the popular trails that afford a out-and-back to some nice vista or other destination. The White Mountains has a large network of trails, with most of them not crowded at all, even during peak season. So don't do the Presi-traverse on the AT. You'll meet lots of people and have a hard time finding a place to camp at night. Instead, make a loop over more obscure side trails.

If you insist on going up to the Presidential ridge, especially near Mt Washington or Lake of the Clouds or Madison huts, you're going to run into people. But that's only a tiny fraction of the available trails, especially if you have the flexibility to not have to get back to a trailhead for three days. Take a good look at the maps. Get the AMC maps printed on Tyvek. Those really do hold up well to water and other trail-abuse. The AMC does a decent job of keeping the trail information on those maps current. They are no doubt the best maps for hiking in the White Mountains.\",\n",

Look at the tread on your hiking boot or running shoe or even tennis shoe, and then look at the sole of your foot. Unless you can pick out a sandy route with no rocks to cross the stream, it is pretty obvious that there will be more friction between the streambed and the shoe than between the streambed and your bare foot, i.e., you will be less likely to slip and fall. The better grip of your shoes also allows you to cross the stream faster. A secondary benefit of crossing with your shoes on is that very cold mountain streams will feel much less cold if your feet are insulated by boots and socks. Yes, your shoes will get wet. But you can pour the water out and pat much of the moisture out with a towel or sweatshirt. You can also change to dry socks. If you have more streams to cross than you have pairs of dry socks, wear a thin undersock of some very low friction material to protect your feet against chafing.',\n",

       "    'body': \"The first step is to make doubly sure there isn't already a bridge, or a common place people already cross at. No sense in getting wet or risking anything if there is an easier, or proper crossing, a few hundred yards up or downstream. The other first step is to make sure you are all safe when you cross. Bring a strong rope that is long enough to span the river, or to at least span to a spot midway where you can take a break. A hundred foot rope strong enough for this purpose should be fine for most typical back country adventures. You can then tie the rope securely to the first person crossing, and hang on to that as a safety device in case the crosser wipes out and loses control. Learn the proper techniques for the ad-hoc harness. The rope also comes in very handy in hauling backpacks or other gear across the river. Once someone makes it across. If the river is not violent, and the danger of falling in is simply that you get wet, have to swim to the other side, then bushwhack through some dense mosquito infested brush to get back to the trail, then you should not use the rope. Use the rope where the danger of falling into the drink is very serious, e.g. a waterfall is not far ahead. As for where to cross, I disagree with Aaron's answer to target a deeper spot. Shallower is better*. Deeper being slower depends on the width of the stream being constant, which isn't always true. Additionally, the force you feel in a deeper section will be greater, and will be higher up on your body, making it more difficult for you to balance. If it's shallower, and you can see the bottom, you're pretty much in the clear as long as you don't rush yourself. When you cross, walk across, slowly and carefully. Contrary to Aaron's answer, don't swim across, walk. You can put your feet down. However, the dangers of getting a foot stuck, as he mentions, are very real and very serious. If you maintain your balance as you walk across, you will be fine. If you lose your balance, immediately pull your feet up, and position yourself flat on your back with your feet in front of you, up high. If the river is violent, your friends can haul you in using the rope. If the river is gentle but strong, then float down in the described position, and paddle yourself to one side or the other, and get out. There is no real technique as far as I am aware, just doggy paddle. Resist the temptation to try and put your feet down to stop you from floating downriver. If the river is deep and fast-moving enough to make this whole ordeal concerning, it is fast enough that if your foot gets stuck you will not be coming back up alive. Afterwards, collect all your gear, dry yourself off, and continue onward. *This answer based on the assumption that the river is not very deep, and where 'shallow' is not any deeper than waist height.\",\n",

As Shem notes in the comment above when canyoneering near water you have to weigh the risk of not falling.

E.g. almost everything would be slippery in sandals. Hiking boots are better, at least not everything is slippery. Best are my canyoning boots. I usually judge slippery as slippery for these canyoning boots. Green surfaces mean there is algae growing. Some algae is brown, but if you are close enough you can detect them as algae nevertheless. This almost always slippery. Then I judge the type of rock. Examples: Limestone is more often polished smooth than other types. Granite is very often non-slippery. One can ponder this when walking to the waterfalls, not even seeing them. Considering the weather a few days ago makes sense, too. Heavy rainfall can wash away slippery films. Really dry weather can dry those out, but can also lead to slippery dust on the rocks. Everything between means, there is somewhere something slippery. At the waterfall I compare rock that is always dry to rock slightly sprayed by water and to rock directly in the water. Usually dry rock is non-slippery. If everything looks the same it is very likely that it's not slippery. Still I am careful; there are exceptions you can not see. If there are heavy differences like in your picture, it is very likely that there are slippery surfaces. I would suspect the lighter parts are slippery there. As a rule of thumb the rock wetted by the spray is very often slippery. Where there is much water, slippery stuff is often washed away, but so are probably you. Last but not least, the slope of the stone you tread on makes it more or less likely for you to slip.\",\n",

Val Marie drinks reverse osmosis water and I took the advice of the rangers and took a supply of such reverse-osmosis water with me. I took a large supply in the car, making sure to start well hydrated in general: a generous drink right before leaving the car plus a realistically large supply on my hike - April isn't that hot out there, but the generally dry air together with the wind means that one does need more drinking water than, say, hiking Vancouver Island in the fog. The water in Val Marie that is not intended for drinking is not de-salted. It doesn't taste good (I tried), but it can be used directly e.g. for showering and it will not leave you with a salt crust like say, swimming in the Mediterranean and then letting yourself dry. Rain water I have a strong suspicion that the topographic map should show most of the little creeks (probably pretty much everything but Frenchman river) as seasonal creeks. At least, I didn't even find puddles in the side coulees where I was (but then that region doesn't get that much snow - I know the preceding winter had uncommonly large amounts of snow in Winnipeg, but I don't know whether that snow extended so far west). The soil is basically gravel with hardly any topsoil: coulees form easily due to water/wind (and nowadays foot) erosion, but water will drain practically immediately. Environment Canada has historical weather data for Val Marie . Over the last 22 years, the chance to hit a day with > 3mm precipitation was >10% for end of April - August/September, with the maximum approaching 20 % in early June (7 day x 22 year averages). But that's still only 1 out of 5 - 6 days in June and you'd probably need to keep in mind that thunderstorms are not necessarily very good for collecting water via tarp. And it is also hard to plan collecting thunderstorm water, because the precipitation tends to be local. Possibly with the exception of right after a thunderstorm, even if there's water in the small creeks, it will have gone through the salty soil. IIRC I was told that Frenchman river isn't that salty (because it carries water from the Rockies), and that freshwater crabs live there though they have a muddy taste. However, when I was there, there were still some of the dams of the former farms intact. These dams were built to collect rain water for the farm use (human + cattle) and contain fresh water. Whether they are still functional 15 years later, and how they look after the reintroduction of bison I have no idea. But back then they were marked in the map (like each single tree) that was available at the ranger station in Val Marie. Some had a tree and were thus easy to find, and at least towards the end of April they were looking fine in terms of water supply (I didn't try though, because I brought sufficient water and did not bring a water filter). Further considerations: When I was there, the park was just under construction (if you want to call it construction) and it was anyways out of season, so everything was very relaxed (I don't know whether there was any other visitor while I was there). I can well imagine that even if the dams are still functional, park regulations may ask you to not touch that water unless in an emergency. Idea: if you plan to cook pasta, boiling in the salty water may be OK (or not - depending on what salts there are; in particular Mg²⁺ and SO4²⁻ both bind large amounts of water and cause diarrhea if not vomiting - so taste a drop first).\",\n",

These are formed when some obstacles get piled up and let a very narrow window for a person to pass through, but the water pass through it. Most of the strainers that you will (unfortunately) come across are likely to be formed by trees and wooden logs. When I could feel being pressed under, I realized that swimming defensively isn't helping at all. Few things to start with: When it rains damn heavy over a day, you can see abrupt rise in water level. Avoid going rafting/kayaking or if you are already out, avoid taking narrow paths in such a situation. That said, you should also consider other water bodies and hazards they may pose. These are easy to locate, whenever you are passing through a narrow water passage with thickets, small trees in contact with the water stream, keep your eyes peeled. Its a perfect place for a strainer to form. If you locate one such strainer, try to get closer to the shore. If you can't and are sure that you are going to go at it, be alert, aggressive. You are likely to be tossed up from your ride. In such a case swim aggressively towards the strainer and with the pace try to stay somewhat above the water that passes below the logs and loft yourself on the log instead letting it swallow you. By aggressive swimming here, I meant go head-first, just when you are about to hit the log, loft up and grab the log, keep your torso up and out of the water. When you can't get around it, go over it with pace. Most of the people who get trapped under one such strainer, have their legs locked in water and thats why they can't get out of the water and get swallowed. So, Try and get your feet up on the surface, that should help you get out quickly with the help of the strong water current. If at all you have to rescue someone out of a strainer, start from the sideways or downstream. Never go upstream as you may end-up at the same place as the victim. He/She will be panicked and approaching him/her upstream would pose a lot of danger as you go against the flow.\",\n",

What you are going to want to do to prevent a catastrophic fall is to clip yourself in to the cables. The minimum equipment for that is a rock climbing harness and a via ferrata setup. A rock climbing helmet would also be a good idea. The caribiners will need to be regular sized (not mini). As you go up the cables, you will have one caribiner connected to the cable at all times. When you get to a post, clip the other caribiner onto the cable on the other side of the post, before removing the first. Like this.

With that said, you DO NOT want to fall, because of the risk of hitting some one else and knocking them down, potentially causing them to fall. The odds are very few people are going to be clipped in. Also, there is traffic going up and down at the same time so be mindful for other people.

In my local environment (temperature / boreal forest) I'd be decently equipped to find water in a local forest that is new to me because even if the exact area is new it is not completely unfamiliar . I have a general feel of the terrain and indicators, and I have a habit of checking topogaphy maps (if not also bringing them with me) before venturing into a new area. My local environment is more like rainforest (~1m precip/yr) but what I'd look for actually overlaps a lot with the question you linked to: Finding water in the dry wilderness I'll zoom in on the two primary guides to water I'd refer to in a new area: Water loving plants and environmental indicators . This is both large scale and small scale, for water sources large and small. On large scale , certain trees and forest types have a tendency to grow in wetter areas, so if you can see these creatures in the landscape they may indicate where you can find water. In my neck of the woods, sparse patches of mainly evergreen forests and some of the following hardwood species indicate wet spots: Yellow Birch (Betula alleghaniensis), Black Birch (Betula nigra), Red Maple (Acer rubrum). As you wander riverside areas, what forest types do you see most often (forest type as in, 3 most common species in the area)? Are there any you mostly see only near wet areas? For small scale , I'm talking about specific plants that retain lots of moisture. You really need to know these plants in advance, or at least know what plants are toxic and indicators of local environmental quality so you avoid harm while exploring plants you're not sure about, and as in any case, where you get sustenance from is susceptible to environmental quality problems. In my neck of the woods I know wild grape vines can contain water and clumpy mosses can be uplifted and squeezed to drain their moisture; neither of these sources provide a lot of water, but it is good to know they're there and in areas that I see good environmental quality indicators and no bad ones (eg. no input-intensive farms nearby, various water quality indicators looking good). Topography. Water flows downhill and accumulates in valleys and depressions. You can head downhill and you will eventually find water (even if it's the ocean!) A major challenge with this is reading the larger landscape and not getting stuck in local variations of the overall landscape. For example, to actually go downhill you may have to go up for a bit, or if you just follow the closest downhill path you may end up stuck in a higher area and not going in the actually easiest direction for lower elevation. If you have or can get a general perspective of the landscape, you are much better off! Knowing the general trends of topography and where rivers span is very valuable. A topographic map and compass are precious in this case, and even if you have neither, being familiar with the overall topography is a huge asset as it tells you what general directions you can reliably go in to find important features (roads, rivers, low spots) rather than 'shooting in the dark'. If you're in the woods and have none of that familiarity, you can try to see particularly high or low areas from openings in canopy or vantage points you can find, and go from there making best guesses about topography. A major challenge in both of these cases is limited visibility due to forest thickness. In that case local topography can be hard to gauge and you really need some familiarity with overall topography trends beforehand. Otherwise you are much worse off, but still trying to use the guides already mentioned is better than wandering aimlessly in search. And of course, an ounce of preparation is worth a pound of cure . Bringing a topography map can make this process way easier, and bringing enough water can make this process unnecessary. And even if you find water, you'll sure want to have at least sufficient containers (or ability to make them) if not also purification methods available.\",\n",

If you prefer to carry zero liters of water and filter each time you drink, that's what you prefer. For people who hike in the Sierra Nevada, backcountry water is safe to drink without treatment [Rockwell 2002], so the answer is different from the answer in your area where the water is unsafe. In the Sierra, where water is generally pretty plentiful, there is seldom any reason to carry any water on your back. Pack an empty Dasani bottle, and when you come to a creek, fill it with nice, safe water, drink it, and then empty the bottle back out before continuing on your hike. Yet another possibility would be that someone hikes a lot in an area where there's a significant risk of getting sick from viruses in the water.

It can be hard to tell whether some innocuous-looking pebbles are a critical habitat for creatures you don't see, but a good guide is to look at how much natural movement of material there is. The side of a fast-moving stream (even one that's dry right now but frequently floods) or a strongly tidal coast is subject to a lot more movement of rocks than us puny humans can manage unaided. They are great places to take your youngster for this kind of play¹, and wildlife that's disturbed can be assumed to be robust enough to tolerate it. On the other hand, many still-water environments (even in man-made places such as old quarries) are more vulnerable to this kind of disruption and are probably best left alone unless you specifically know otherwise. ¹ I'm assuming that you have the safety aspect covered; that's not within the scope of this answer.\",\n",

If you have air great, breathe it. If you are in a stable spot great, use it to figure out your next move but never give up. Eddy These are whirlpools which form along the vertical axis. The form as water passes around the sides of a rock or other obstruction. Most paddlers identify eddies as islands of safety since it is one method to make river running easier and safer. In powerful enough water these \"whirl pools\" or more typically \"eddy lines\" can pull down swimmers and even boats, but they weaken as they move down stream. Waiting out the down time and moving for shore or into the main current is typically all that is needed to handle these. Starting small and experimenting with these features will give you a good idea when to play with these features and when to avoid them. Hole These are whirlpools which form on the horizontal axis as water moves over a rock or other obstruction. The current in a hole is surface water moving upstream and deep water moving downstream. At the upstream side of the hole water is plunging deep and at the downstream end water is percolating upwards. The real trick is how big are you or your boat compared to the hole. If you are very big you will stay on the surface and will likely not be stopped in the first place. If you are very small you will likely go underwater with but resurface well down stream. If you are in that magic size in the middle you will get stuck. In Boat Hole Exits In a boat there are a few strategies for exiting the feature. The first most are likely to try is reaching downstream and grabbing downstream moving water. This rarely works and most that try put their shoulders at risk. This will only work on the weakest of features. The next step is to work towards the corners of the hole. Most holes are not perpendicular to the current and \"kick\" either left or right. Don\\'t fight the kick. Sometimes this means backing out of the hole if your boat is facing the wrong way. If one side doesn\\'t seem to work try the other. If the hole pushes you back to the middle (frown shaped looking downstream) then you will need to try something different. Purposely flipping the boat might present enough surface area from your body to push you downstream. It\\'s amazing the number of features that will hold an upright boat all day but immediately flush an upside down boat. If that doesn\\'t work try throwing ends. You don\\'t need to a be a freestyle expert to try this. Just plug your bow or stern in the upstream current and the boat will go deep and vertical. The goal is to go as deep as you can to catch more of the downstream water and sometimes even jump over some recirculating water. If none of this works and help isn\\'t available an out of boat rescue may be the next move. Out of Boat Hole Exits Much like flipping seems to turn many would be keepers into a flushing hole, it\\'s amazing how many features will flush a swimmer immediately after a long a violent ride in the boat. Of coarse swimming offers it\\'s own hazards and should be avoided whenever possible. Most river fatalities occur when swimming not inside boats. If you do not flush immediately you are dealing with a very dangerous feature and not a lot of time. There is basically 3 things you can do, swim (on your belly freestyle strokes) at the edges of the holes and into upstream current, cannonball and starfish. My immediate move would be to swim aggressively into the upstream current When I hit it starfish to maximize surface area and cannonball when the jet of current pushes less to reduce surface area and go deep. If that doesn\\'t work try again and if that doesn\\'t work try a different combination of the above. Basically swim, cannonball, starfish offer 3 different moves that will work most of the time. That said not always. Some features you can\\'t get out of without help. Rescue Exits There are a number of rescue techniques for getting someone else out of a bad feature. They simplest and most common is a throw rope. Boat based rescues can also be good but can easily turn one victim into two. Use with caution. Avoidance The really good news about all this is avoidance is fairly easy. Most bad features occur at man made dams. Whenever you see one, your first instinct should be to look for a place to get out and look at the feature to see what you are dealing with. If you can\\'t read water, portage around even if it looks like a small easy drop. Naturally occurring features like this typically only happen on advanced rivers where water reading skills and setting safety are ubiquitous. The rare feature the occurs on an easier river will be well known to locals and as always they should be tapped for run information whenever possible.',\n",

In the winter, the water is crystal clear, the clearest I've ever seen in my life. After spring run off however the water turns grey with all the limestone rock flour from the mountains, and it stays that way almost all the way through the summer, then it goes green. Fishing in those lakes at those times is almost pointless if you're fishing with a cast and lure. The fish just can't see the lure through the murk. Ive been fishing with fish jumping all around me in those lakes and not so much as had a bite. Fly fishers have more success because their fly leaves a shadow on the water, which can be seen from below as a dark spot in the light on the surface, and the fish recognize as food. Most all lakes in the mountains are stocked with fish, that much is true for the Canadian Rockies at least. The flour actually does more to help the fish in those lakes than it does to hinder them. In mountain lakes fish are primarily preyed upon by raptors, bears, otters, and other critters. In the turbid waters the fish are safely concealed so they can't be spotted by predators. People out here will actually dye their private ponds so the fish can't be seen to protect them from birds of prey. If they don't then the eagles and hawks will snatch all the fish out of their ponds in no time.\",\n",

This is similar to this question , but less related to survival and more about typical backpacking trips. I'm often going solo and on well maintained trails, but without a bridge at the streams.

       "    'body': \"Short answer: You can't judge a wet rock's traction by appearance. The slipperiness usually depends on a biofilm on the rocks themselves. That, in turn, will vary depending on flow velocity, turbidity, sand carried by the water, and most importantly, how long the rock has been underwater. I found out the hard way crossing a knee deep stream after a rainfall. The rocks at the edge had good traction. As soon as I reached the main channel, the rocks were as slippery as goose grease on a brass doorknob. I fell, but caught myself in an extended push-up position, and very carefully hand-and-foot crawled to where the rocks were less slimy. Different footwear can help. After all, aluminium canoes seem to stick very well to wet slimy rocks. I have had better results using a softer rubber sole. Based on canoes, I suspect that aluminium hobnails would work, but these would wear very fast on normal rocky trails. I haven't tested them. I make a point to give the upper end of waterfalls a wide berth. I have however gotten my canoe stuck in interesting places, and a couple of times one of my party has stepped on a slippery rock, sometimes with a slope no greater than the camber of a paved road, and slowly but unstoppably slid out into the river or lake.\",\n",

I'd recommend not travelling by foot in those areas. If you must hike in those areas, make some noise so that they can hear you coming . Boar are mostly crepuscular (active near dawn and dusk) and can be very grumpy if surprised or if they are defending their babies. Again, make some noise so that you don't surprise them. You can often smell them before you can see them . Snakes require attention while you are hiking. They are most likely to sense your presence by feeling the vibrations of your footsteps. Be especially careful if you are hiking in areas with lots of leaf litter, where it will be difficult for them to detect your footsteps. Watch ahead of you, and do not step or reach into brush or tussocks of grass. Brown cobras are especially fond of hiding in the vegetation. Wild elephants are increasingly rare but can be a problem in some very wild areas (such as Mudumalai). Should you encounter elephants, back up slowly and calmly. Do not run from a false charge (ears out and trunk up), but seek cover immediately from a real charge (ears back and trunk tucked up under the chin). When camping, the usual morning precautions are in order-- shake out your boots before putting them on and shake out your bedding before rolling it up.

A few medium size dry bags are good as they allow you to divide your kit up easily. Black bin liners are definitely the cheaper option though. Another option or additionally you may want a bag cover (these often come with hiking rucksacks). I've found these to be less effective. Also make sure your bag cover is well attached to your rucksack. I've seen someone's blow off in the wind, resulting in them chasing it across a field. This was amusing for me at least. Survival bag/blanket. You should probably carry one of these anyway. I've seen two main types - the silver space blanket type ones and the orange plastic bodybag type.

I have no interest in crossing wearing my walking boots as so many people like to do as wet feet are the worst of all options. Yes I could remove my socks and cross, but the water in the boot will just wick into my socks as soon as I put the socks back on. I also don't want to be crossing in bare feet for obvious reasons. This leaves me with buying some alternative footwear just for crossing rivers (I'll wear my boots the rest of the time). Other than Crocs, what would people recommend? I've been making a big effort to reduce my pack weight recently, so the lighter the better. A rigid sole would be nice, but I'm not too bothered about the cold as I'll only be wearing them for crossings.\",\n",

       "    'body': \"There is one more important technique you can use that I was taught in New Zealand, where you have to cross rivers all the time. If you have a group of people (at least 3), you can greatly enhance safety by forming a chain in the following way: Position the strongest person upstream, the second-strongest person downstream and the weakest person in the middle. Open your hip belts. Every person holds onto the next persons waist by putting their arm between the neighbors back and pack: Start crossing slowly. Keep your boots on for stability and protection from sharp rocks. The line of people you form should be parallel to the flow. That way, the stronger persons at the end of the chain break the strength of the river for the people in the middle while they themselves get supported by the middle people. Cross diagonally, moving across and downstream. That takes much less force than fighting the current. A note on shoes: I was taught to leave them on. Riverbeds are slippery and can have sharp rocks. Your shoes protect you. And once out of the water, the small amount of water in your shoes warms up quickly and forms an insulating layer similar to a wetsuit. Or so they say :) I have done the above in relatively cold water (no ice floating on it, but it was of glacial origin) and didn't suffer frostbite. Image taken from Queenstown Team Building & Group Development . EDIT: I forgot to say that, of course, the first and most important skill when it comes to river crossing is the skill to make the right decision. Rivers can swell quite quickly in rain, but once rain is over, those rivers that flood fast also drop fast. I was held up for a night by a waist-deep side-creek that flooded due to rain, and in the next morning it was only ankle deep. If you are unsure whether you have a good reason to attempt a crossing or not, imagine that your crossing led to a fatality and you have to explain yourself to the grieving family. If you are in a survival situation, you might have a legitimate reason, but any sort of man-made deadline becomes irrelevant. (Wanting to be back in time for Super Bowl, or even wanting to be back in time for work, is not as important as not drowning).\",\n",

       "    'body': \"I realize you already made your trip, but I will answer your question anyhow. These tips are not regionally constrained to the Olympic Peninsula. 1) Footwear When setting out to wet places or in rainy weather always take a second pair of boots. In my experience from the army every shoe will let in water sooner or later under heavy rain. Always pack a couple of durable plastic bags with two heavy duty rubber bands (useful for other tasks as well). So if you have to cross a stream you just step in the bags and seal them off over your calves with the rubber. They will get you through wider streams than you'd think. Keep in mind: improvise - adapt - overcome. Always bring your wits when you go hiking. Change your socks often. 2) Clothing Clothing is very individual, and everyone finds out what becomes him most. However I am of the opinion to dress light. You should be cold before you walk. If your still cold after the first mile, walk faster! You cannot avoid perspiration, but try to limit it. Soaked feet will not be a problem for 3 days and 30 miles, but better learn good habits early. Use synthetic material that can dry fast. Get some nice comfortable cotton clothes for the evening/night, but make sure they stay dry. Do not wear them while sleeping, even without a tent perspiration during the night in the enclosed sleeping bag will make them humid. Also, sleeping bags warm better through direct contact to the skin. 3) Packing Use compression bags to pack your clothes. You save space and will be able to pack a sturdier pack and well-distribute weight. This makes a hug difference the heavier your pack gets. I assume you know this, but just to be complete on these essentials: Carry the weight on your hips, not your shoulders! The hip belt and frame are the most important features of a pack. Consider buying a Camelback (cannot post more than 2 links sorry). Having the water easily accessible through the hose will encourage you to drink. It's easy to forget drinking in cold weather, but it is very unpleasant later on and can get dangerous sooner than you might expect. 4) Sleeping Another useful tip in cold and wet weather, assuming your a purist and not sleeping with a closed tent, is to put your walking clothes that are humid between the inner and the outter layer of the sleeping bag: The heat from the inside will dry them through the night (just remember to let the outer cover rather loose so the hot and humid air can escape. With a closed tent you can use a one layer sleeping bag and hang the clothes in the tent (but leave it open so warm and humid air gets out). Buy a Jetboil . In a less than two minutes you can fill a bottle with hot water. By holding this to your chest and belly you will fall asleep easily even in extremely cold weather. Before you drift off throw the bottle to the bottom of the bag, warm feet are a luxurious pleasure when sleeping in cold weather. Might seem ridiculous to mention, but you never know who might read this: before Hiking anywhere, especially alone, be sure of your navigating skills! Always bring a compass and a map. I understand we have access to GPS and iPhones and whatnot - but I know just as well that whatever can go wrong eventually goes wrong. It is Murphy's Law. Google it. A compass and a map doesn't go wrong, as well as informing someone of your approximate locations and est. return date. Trust in the most simple solutions.. it should be at least your plan B.\",\n",

The Squeeze is a hollow fiber filter which can be forced (squeezed). It is affordable , reliable and simple to use . The water is available immediately; you can even drink as you filter. I find it easier to use than a pump-style filter. You may also use it as part of a gravity system. The Squeeze requires back-flushing using a syringe . In my experience, this is rarely required if the water is relatively clean. You may choose to bring the syringe with you although I personally would not. Another option is to mail it to yourself for long hikes (i.e. bounce box). With clear water it repeatedly worked just fine for weeks-long stretches. When it requires back-flushing you will notice reduced flow rates. The filter is remarkably simple and does not have many moving parts. I did have problems with the O-Ring becoming misshapen, which resulted in leaks and un-usability. The problem corrected itself after a certain time. You should not tighten the bottle too hard as it may cause issues (now I know). I also owned a MSR HyperFlow but had it failed on me in the field. I would not recommend it as it is more error-prone and more costly than the Squeeze. Ceramic filters are also reliable and field maintainable. However, I personally had bad luck with those as the cartridge broke down on a trip. For non-filters, you could use a drops such as Aquamira. I would recommend transferring the contents of the bottles into a secondary container as the corners of the bottles tend to crack and leak. I've had it happen to me twice and I have met other hikers with the same problem. I believe Aquamira is aware of the problem but I do not know if they have corrected it. You could also keep them in the original plastic box which offers some extra protection for those sad cornered bottles. SteriPens are great but unreliable for multi-week trips and costly (battery usage).\",\n",

The safest option when traveling in a geyser basin is to stay on the established trail or boardwalk. Geothermal features do occasionally form under a trail, but it's not common, and trails are generally monitored for this. If you need to go off-trail and you're not familiar with the basin in question, the safest option is to only step where there are plants growing. The presence of live plants is a sign that the ground is cool.

Sticking to well established rivers (which are already trashed) limits this impact. If you do enter a new river, be very wary of the damage you are causing and try and limit this as best you can, do not return until some months later, when the river has had time to recover. Stay off the banks (this is where the most erosion is caused) keep to the river channel where the water limits the erosion you cause Generally organised groups and companies stick to well established rivers, this limits the impact to a few rivers (which do actually suffer quite badly for this but at least it's only a few rivers and not lots of rivers!).

Travel writer Fabrizio Frascaroli describes fording this river; I have included an excerpt below, a bit long but I found it too beautiful to shorten. Fabrizio was hiking from Nýidalur , a location at least 20 km (as the crow flies) east of Þjórsárkvíslar. I will be arriving from the north, from the area around Klakkur / Háalda / Háölduhraun , so my route is different. Counting on the DMA C761 map , there are 23 small (<18 metre) and and 2 intermediate (18–25 metre) crossings between Klakkur and Arnarfell, with the biggest ones at 28N 7182500 619250 and 28N 7174900 611200. Þjórsárver is in the middle of it. I don't know exactly where this wide but shallow and quiet river is located but it looks unproblematic despite its large size. What is the safest route for crossing Þjórsárkvíslar when arriving from the north? Are there any established locations that travellers have used in centuries past, perhaps indicated by cairns or not? I wake up to my alarm clock at 3:30 in the night: it is time to wade, and the favour of the morning’s earliest hours is required, however masochistic that may feel. The weather conditions look optimal for the upcoming challenges: entirely dry, still, and as cold as it gets in July. It must be roughly 8am when I start the Þjórsárkvíslar crossing: the dreaded springs of Þjórsá, Iceland’s longest river. One after the other, I leave behind all the threads of an endless web of streams and rivulets. I feel a mixture of relief and disappointment about the smoothness of my progression, but it is not meant to last much longer; it is promptly dissolved by the appearance of the river’s last branch, frightening in all its breadth and might, surrounded by the notoriety of grim tales and warnings. The water’s depth varies in a range generously estimated to be between 50cm and 150cm. The prospect of confronting a violent flow up to my chest has admittedly been the source of many headaches over the last few days. In the end, however, the Þjórsárkvíslar will not treat me that badly. The water level suddenly rises above my waist, but with a detour upstream I am able to find a relatively innocuous course in shallow waters, all the way to the other bank. I do not know how long I have been soaking in the river, probably some ten minutes. What’s certain is that as I gain the high ground again, the bite of the cold has made me totally hazy, I am speaking in tongues and can hardly remember how to spell my own name.

(2) If not closed, you will generally have to supply your own water. OK - options for you. First, instead of the Sandias, I might suggest the Manzanos, the range to the south. Get off at the Tijeras exit of I40, go south, and there are a series of Forest Service campgrounds along the east side of the Manzanos. The first is Fourth of July campground, with some nice hikes right there. Further south is Red Canyon campground, with a nice loop including a side trail to Manzano Peak (over 10000 feet). Besides @OlinLathrop's suggestion of Mt Taylor (great views, lots of snow right now), there are a variety of campgrounds on the south side of I40 along the Zuni mountains. I've done less out that way, but there is plenty of hiking there as well. Somewhat off the beaten path, but El Morro National Monument is less than an hour south of Grants NM. They have a campground (although it does not seem to be mentioned on their web site anymore - you should call first) and some day hikes there. Along the road are various turn offs in to the El Malpais (mostly BLM land), with hikes and caving in the lava tubes (great fun). But, for the true New Mexico experience, I would direct you to Chaco Canyon. It will be about 2.5 hours from Albuquerque, with the last 30 minutes on a pretty good dirt road. The camp ground is open year round, and water is available. There are 4 back country trails in addition to the great house ruins in the canyon. The loop (3-4 miles) up the north side of the canyon to the Pueblo Alto complex has fabulous views of ruins in the canyon, as well as to the north into Colorado. The longer (7 miles) hike to Penasco Blanco at the end of Chaco Wash takes you by many petroglyphs. Both can be done in one day, if starting early. And, providing you have talked to the rangers before hand about the road conditions, you can exit the park to the south, meeting up with I40 near Gallup (the north entrance dirt road is pretty good, the south may require real four wheel drive).

The \"slickrock\" areas of southern UT are a different experience, with lots of open rock: In these areas, the relatively hard sandstone doesn\\'t erode much so the occasional downpour washes away what little soil forms over time. That together with the dry conditions leaves large areas of mostly beadrock with wide open vistas. This open bedrock is locally called slickrock , although it\\'s actually not slick at all, even when wet. These pictures are from Grand Staircase - Escalante in southern UT. There are also slot canyons in this area that aren\\'t what you asked for, but worth exploring (in my opinion) if you\\'re there anyway: In short, there are many areas of the US southwest that fit your requirements.',\n",

       "    'body': \"If hiking makes you feel anxious, then don't go hiking. If you do go hiking, as with most activities, you should pay attention to what your are doing. That includes listening to what is around you. Part of the enjoyment for most hikers is experiencing the outdoors. You can't do that as fully when you disable one of your senses. Leave the music player and headphones home, and instead listen to the birds, the insects, the water running nearby, the sound of your feet on different surfaces, or that unexpected rustle off to the side. If these are really not as interesting, fun, soothing, and stimulating to you as music, then I don't understand why you go hiking in the first place. There is also a safety issue. To be fair, the things I'm about to describe are unlikely occurances, so most of the time you can be oblivious to them and get away with it. However, these things do occasionally happen, so having your ears open can be the difference between having a hike and being a statistic. For example, hearing a hissing sound 10 feet in front of you by the side of the trail can prevent a rattlesnake bite. Hearing little rattling sounds or even rumbling on the slope above you can alert you to falling rocks. Unstable snow sometimes makes a sound, which can warn of avalanche risk. A swooshing sound can help you prepare to not get sand blown in your eyes from a dust devil. Bears sometimes make huffing sounds as a last warning. A gurgling sound under the ice signals obvious danger, as does a cracking sound. Keeping track of the direction of gunshot sounds is a really good idea. Hearing the whistling of a bullet means you almost got hit, and it's time to do something about it. If you think that last one is far fetched, it has actually happened to me. I got down on the ground and yelled as loud as I could. The yahoos around the hill a bit packed up their rifles and beer coolers and skedaddled out of there. They may have thought they hit me, and didn't want to be identified. At least it was a peaceful night after that.\",\n",

I canyoneer without sticky canyoneering shoes (because they're expensive and I'm cheap) and I slip and fall all the time while getting over the edge of a waterfall or while rappelling down a particularly slippery part. However, I never fall into an uncontrolled descent while doing this because my brake hand NEVER leaves the rope. If you fall, you grab the rope tight, stop your rappel, recompose yourself and start again. As Mr. Wizard mentioned, adding friction will help you control your speed. You can do this simply by holding the rope around the side of your leg instead of off to the side of you. Any curves you can add to the rope will add friction. It's also a good idea to invest in a device that allows you to add friction while you rappel specifically for situations like this where the base friction of your device may change based on other factors. The CRITR2, SQWUREL and ATS are all great devices to look into that allow you to add friction while rappelling. That way if you start off and feel like you're going to fast, you can always add more friction to slow yourself down. You can check out the gear I mentioned here: http://www.store.canyoneeringusa.com/component/rokecwid/?Itemid=108#!/Rappel-Devices/c/2490786/offset=0&sort=normal Keep in mind those are just a few well known canyoneering descenders, there's many more.

The day before yesterday it rained for the first time in weeks, so the river held a lot of clear non-smelly water. I was wondering if it was safe to drink the water after a long time without rain. The reason for this: I once lived in a house which got its water from a natural spring. Every so often we had to boil the water because after long periods of drought the first rain washed a lot of chemicals from a nearby road into the spring. The water then smelled and looked fine to drink but contained small particles of rubber and oils from cars. There is no road near the river in question, but maybe the forest could accumulate similar contaminants (human waste, dead animals, etc.) and wash them downstream with the first rain after a drought. This question is about drinking water in the alps, but does not address the issue with contaminants that might not be visible/smellable in the water. This paper mentions on multiple occasions the problems of contaminated water after rainfall in urban areas. Maybe there is an equivalent for situations in the wilderness.',\n",

This article suggests some ways (quoted below) to avoid Giardia (which has a similar lifecycle to Cryptosporidium ), conversely, if you are unable to source water following these guidlines the greater risk of Cryptosporidium contamination. Drink from large streams whenever possible, preferably those entering from the side rather than those paralleling the trail. Water in fast-flowing streams is safer because any contaminants present at any location are swept downstream, being quickly displaced by presumably clean water from above. Water at higher elevations is safer, partly because of reduced human and animal presence, and partly because water flowing to lower elevations has a chance to pick up more contaminants the farther it travels. Taking water from a lake is best advised at the inlet, with the next best place at the outlet. Inlet water has a tendency to flow somewhat directly to the outlet, undergoing little mixing with the lake water as a whole. Few Giardia cysts survive harsh Sierra winters. Contamination begins essentially anew each year, so springtime water is safer than summer or fall. The colder the water is, the more likely it is freshly melted, meaning less opportunity for contamination. Because filtration of water through soil removes Giardia cysts, deep well water is considered safe. By implication, springs in the wilderness should be, too. One would think that, after a heavy snow year when streams run full and long, some kind of \"flushing out\" of lakes and streams must be occurring. Conversely, it makes sense to be more cautious in dry years. Avoid water that likely could have passed through an area subject to heavy human or animal use.

No evidence of fecal coliform, Giardia lamblia, or coccidia, was found in Garnet Creek. The water quality and general water chemistry of Garnet Creek was similar to the reference site. No Giardia lamblia or coccidia were found in Cascade Creek, but fecal coliforms were present.

Those can include: Getting scraped or cut on either the bottoms or sides of your feet. Culprits could be various sharp items, including broken shells, broken glass, pieces of fish hooks, bottle caps or other sharp litter. Stubbing your toes on rocks, pebbles, or unexpected items in the water. Slipping on rocks, or river bottom areas, that are wet or slimy from something like algae. Twisting an ankle or two due to lack of support. Being bitten by something in the water. Picking up a bacterial infection from something in the water Losing your balance as you go in or out of the water at the crossing point In areas of very clear water, many obstacles can be avoided, and slipping would be the most likely problem. If the water is dark or murky, you're more likely to step on something just because you couldn't see it. Some of the hazards might be more likely if you're carrying a backpack, especially if it's heavy. For instance, if the load shifts you may lose your footing more easily, whereas the support of a shoe might keep you more steady. Also, if anyone in the group has a pre-existing condition that makes barefoot walking less than ideal to start with, they might be more susceptible to problems in the water. That's true for me.

The easiest thing way to find water is to have the water come to you. Make sure people know where you are going in advance, and when to expect you back. That way, you can expect a rescue, and the rescuers will know where to look for you. Stay in the shade as much as possible, doze during daylight when it's hottest, and limit activity at night. Depending on how hot it is, you can survive one or two days like this without drinking anything. If finding shade means leaving the trail, mark where you leave the trail, and mark a trail to where you find the shade to make it easy for your rescuers. If you've planned well, you will have a map with springs and manmade ponds for livestock marked on it. These are not perfectly reliable; springs dry up, ponds get abandoned, and especially in remote places this may not be reflected in the maps for years. It's also entirely possible that you are 20 miles or more from the closest water source. Now here's the answer that assumes you went on a hike without telling anyone, got lost without a map, and now need to survive an indefinite period of time. The best place to find water is in the mountains. Solid rock has nooks and crannies that will hold water after it rains. If it rains on a flat, the water runs off or is absorbed in minutes in most cases. If you can get to north facing slopes where there's been a thunderstorm in the last week or two, you have a very good chance of finding enough water to not die. The longer the time since the last rain, the fewer water sources, but there are (rare) natural holding tanks that can hold water for years. If you remain in the desert flats with no expectation of rescue, you will almost certainly die unless you happen to be close to a safe spring. You can't cut open a cactus and drink. In the Mojave, if you see dense greenery, it means there's water nearby, but it may be underground or poisonous. If you know your plants, you can recognize the ones that can't tolerate high mineral contents. Easier would be to watch for wildlife. Insects and other animals using the water is a good sign, as is green algae.\",\n",

This means, try to get many low-intensity but long training sessions. For your cardiovascular system it doesn't matter in the first place whether you do this by bike, running or hiking, just keep it long and easy. You basically wouldn't need any anaerobic exercise for that, however going to the gym or some climbing doesn't do any harm. For base endurance Steve House's Training for the New Alpinism recommends running or hiking over cycling as with cycling you are sitting and don't have to engage your core muscles that much which you will need to stabilize your body. I for myself am tempted to deviate a bit for that since Steve House seems to have only road cycling in mind if he thinks of cycling. In my experience mountain biking is not that bad here since it invokes a greater part of the body. In my personal experience also the type of load that you put on your thighs when pedaling is quite similar to that you have when when walking up over block terrain where you often have ascend up over steps of 20 to 50 cm height. Concerning running, don't care too much about intervals, up- and downhills and stuff, but focus on long and easy runs and not on pushing for speed. If you feel like doing some intervals, then do so, but sparsely. If you have some nice hilly ways to run then do that every now and then but don't concentrate too much on them (especially not in the early phase of your training, you can shift a bit more on those as your trip comes closer). In hilly terrain concentrate on the uphills – running downhill is primarily putting your leg joints at risk and doesn't give you much benefit, so see it as a necessary thing that you need to do to compensate for the uphill elevation gain but don't search it. If you run in hilly terrain try to combine steep uphills with flat downhills to maximize uphill performance and minimize injury risk. For hiking, in general don't take a heavier backpack than you have to (you can of course every now and then, to get a bit used to it and if you want to check things like if it fits) but try to have fun and get a long endurance workout. If possible, try to get your hikes in terrain that resembles a mountain tour, i.e. don't walk the rolling hills with 50m up, 50m down but try to get somewhere where you can have an hour or more of uphill followed by a downhill. In this case practice to hike quick but stay in the zone of aerobic exercise. As a recent song by Meghan Trainor says: It's all about that base !\",\n",

The arguments for are simple: allow bikes so cyclists can enjoy nature while doing a healthy activity they also enjoy. Bikes are faster than hiking, allowing you to explore more trail in a day, make the descents a lot easier, and also enable older people who can\\'t hike well (bad knees) to still enjoy a gentle trail by cycling. The arguments against are mainly related to trail maintenance and safety. Bikes can make a mess out of muddy hiking trails, especially when strong cyclists try to pedal through the mud and dig up ruts, but maintenance wise that the only con to a bike, unless you want to include tire tracks on rocks. The main concern is safety; people bombing down a popular trail and colliding with hikers, or scaring horses, which usually results in people getting bucked off and hurt. Parks are concerned about liability. Mountain Biking is a high speed sport, and high speed sports are all capable of producing serious injuries. Park officials don\\'t want to have to deal with crashes and wipeouts, or complaints from jumpy hikers about that crazy cyclist who passed them going \"dangerously fast\". Parks are all about keeping the peace, which mostly means the peace and quiet in the administration building, they don\\'t want to deal with paperwork, which incidents of any type create for them. It\\'s easier to ban an activity then it is to deal with the injuries and drama from it.',\n",

What I personally do on longer bike tours is to wear a trail running backpack . These are ultra-light backpacks that sit very high on your back and generally have a sophisticated system of straps to be very secure even while running long distances. In my experience this makes them uniquely suited also for mountain biking, as they will be comfortable and securely fastened to your back, while still not being heavy or bulky, and thus don't restrict your movement. Many examples for trail running backpacks can be found on Google . The one I personally use for moutain biking is MTR 201 from Mammut:\",\n",

       "    'body': \"In my experience, as a mountain biker of 20-years, you want to seek weight minimization and distribution. A heavy pack (assuming a non-trivial ride length) is going to cause your lower back to hurt, make you hotter (back can't breathe), and put additional stress on the palms of your hands - all of which become more problematic the longer you ride. A heavy load on the back of your bike (rack or carrier) will interfere with your front-tires ability to remain in contact with the ground - making climbing and steering more difficult. A heavy load on the center of your bike and lower down will cause your bike to feel more sluggish - harder to turn and make for a less enjoyable ride. First and foremost, ask yourself what you can get rid of. Consider carrying patches + 1 - tube instead of 2 tubes. If you know you will have streams in the area, get a good filtration bottle to lighten the H20 load. Can you learn anything about the vegetation that will allow you to eat local plant-life to reduce the food you carry? Do you have high-end clothing that is both light and protective? You weren't really specific so these may be off base. The point is to be really creative on how you can carry less. No matter where you store it, less weight will always feel better as the ride gets longer. Also, you might consider a bike trailer. There are some really nice ones (example) that minimally interfere with your ride and will do a much better of carrying your gear comfortably than trying to put it all on you or your bike.

       "    'body': 'It isn\\'t so much about the training as it is about the recovery. Professional cyclists are on the bike for 700-1000 kilometers a week, often with two different training sessions in a day, and multiple days in a row. Same for any endurance athlete, such as triathletes, marathoners, ultra runners, etc. The bad news is, that if they aren\\'t training, they are resting/recovering with a team of professionals, which you most likely don\\'t have. The good news is, you won\\'t be sustaining the training load that they are either which means that you can easily achieve the commuting goal. So lets look at this from the ground up (if you will pardon the pun). As was pointed out, the training portion was a bit glossed over. As I understand it, you want the bike commute to supplement training for sport climbing and hiking/mountaineering. I think that cycling would provide an ideal supplement training, as it will increase cardio, is low impact, and more importantly will strengthen the muscles of the leg which in turn will help stabilize the knee. For the morning commute, not much variation is needed other than the straight ride, as you don\\'t want to arrive at work wiped out for an hour. If you have a desk job, you will have ample recovery during the day for any evening activity. If you have a more active job, make the morning commute as easy as possible. Find a comfortable gear so that you are neither \"spinning\" rapidly or pushing mightily. It should just feel comfortable. For the evening commute, on days that you are not intending on walking/hiking at home, you can add in items like getting back up to speed as soon as possible after stops, going out of your way a bit to add in hills, items like that. That will give you some speed work as well as muscle development. If you are intending on walking/hiking/climbing that evening, then treat it as you do the morning commute. Light on the actual work, use it as a warm up. Concentrate on making the \"full circle\" on the pedals, so that while one leg is pushing down, the other is pulling up. This takes some practice to get used to. For a sample schedule, I would lay it out something like this: Monday - Bike commute if weekend was easy (or you rested on Sunday), otherwise rest or bike 1 way only Tuesday - Bike commute easy/easy, easy hike Wednesday - Bike commute easy/hard, or no commute + moderate hike Thursday - No commute, easy hike or rest Friday - Commute easy/hard, no hike Saturday - Hike as you want Sunday - Same as Saturday or rest That kind of a schedule should serve you well initially, and there is no real reason that you could not work up to commuting every day and hiking most days as well. That is where the self monitoring comes in, if you know you have a hard hike coming up, rest on the commute portion, or if you are knackered, take a day off from commute/hiking. For other considerations: What kind of bike? Considering your history, the first thing that you want to consider is what kind of bike to get. I personally would recommend either a hardtail mountain bike, or a commuter/cross type bike. A typical racing type bike isn\\'t the best for commuting, and the others would allow you to commute and use it for general recreation. The cycling adage is, you can have light, cheap and reliable. Pick two. I would recommend avoiding the big box stores (Walmart, Target, Dicks sporting, etc) as they will have the lower end. While that is not a bad thing, I don\\'t like the component groups that they come with. YMMV, find one you like. If you can test ride a few even better. If worse comes to worse and you hate cycling, the resale is much better as well. As pointed out in the comments, you can get puncture resistant tires and tubes, and add in a protective slime, the trade off is in the weight of the bike. Fit is CRITICAL Even if you buy a big box bike, I would first find a bike shop that offers a fitting service. Usually this is free if you purchase a bike, or may cost a few $$ if you just want the numbers. But, especially with your knee and ankle surgeries, you want the correct saddle height and crank length (The crank is the piece that holds the pedals and the chain). If you don\\'t fit those correctly, you will cause more pain/potential trouble in your legs and potentially hips/lower back. If you have oddly splayed feet (I have feet that point out), you can even get custom clipless pedals with specified spindle lengths (How far out from the crank the pedal is). This lets you pedal with a more natural motion and foot position. Also, find a saddle/seat that you are comfortable on. More people give up cycling because they have an ass hatchet for a seat than anything. Jeez, man, I\\'m not even on the bike yet! Ok, now you have a bike. And a helmet. Never get on a bike without a helmet. If you are new to cycling, then I wouldn\\'t recommend just jumping in and cycling both ways every day. Ease into it, get used to the bike, handling in traffic, all of that before fully committing to the commute. The good news on that front, is that 18km an hour is right around 12 mph, and that is a relatively leisurely pace. Even a recreational cyclist should be able to sustain that without too much training stress. Some ways that you could also ease into it, is see if bus lines go the same way. Where I live in the US, most buses have bike racks on the front so that you could cycle to work, then take the bus home or partway. Or, if you can leave your car at work, drive to work with your car, cycle home, then cycle back the next day. As another poster suggested, once you get used to it, you can sprint for stop signs, add in small training items without causing too much stress. If you\\'re tired, simply skip a day. You\\'re doing this for health, not training for a race. The basic back and forth every day should not put enough stress on you that you need tons of recovery, so eating well and getting a good nights sleep should be all you need, especially as you get more used to the exercise. Cycling is also very minimal impact, so you don\\'t have the same recovery requirements as you would for running or other heavier impact items. Wait, you mean there is more? Some other items/things to consider as you start on this journey. Work accommodations - Is there a place to lock up your bike? A place to change clothes? Possibly shower? Clothing - Pack your work clothes, cycle in other stuff. You will get dirty, get chain grease on your leg, get rain/snowed on, etc. Just take a pack with your stuff. If it\\'s going to rain, stuff it in a waterproof container (I used a trash bag, honestly). Other items - In addition to the helmet, I have a small pack that fits under my seat. I carry tire irons, extra tubes, some CO2 cartridges for inflation, a little bit of $$ just in case, and a laminated paper with medical/contact information. Cycling gear - Helmet, bike shorts (See below), cycling gloves. Be prepared - You will crash. There are 2 types of cyclists, those that have crashed and those that lie about it. Either through no fault of your own, or you miss a patch of gravel/ice and slide down. Learn to fall safely. Consider upper body weight routines - Cycling is all cardio and lower body. For general lifestyle, I would add upper body exercises to balance. You can find a lot of body weight type exercises that can be done at home without equipment or with minimal investment. (You can check the Fitness stack for some ideas). Practice You didn\\'t just get in your car and start driving everywhere. You practiced. Same with the bike. Get on a friendly commuter trail and just get used to the bike. If you do get clipless pedals, sit on the bike next to a post or fence for balance, and just practice unclipping and clipping in. Even with that, expect to come to a stop sign and fall over because you can\\'t get your foot out. I do that about 2x a year, honestly. Take the bike into a grassy area or field and fall over. Don\\'t reach out to brace with your hands, you\\'ll break your wrists. Just kind of lean over and roll onto your hips. Get some comfortable cycling shorts. Remember the point about the saddle? Same goes for clothing. Don\\'t skimp on the contact points. It doesn\\'t have to be the lycra bib looking things (Although they are uber comfortable), but something that will make it more enjoyable to spend some time cycling. Good gloves, with hand padding. Also if you will be cycling in various weather conditions, get weather appropriate clothing. Remember if it is cold and raining, it will be cold, raining and windy on a bike (You create your own headwind). There is nothing more miserable than being cold, tired and hungry with another 20 miles left to go on the ride. argumentum ad verecundiam (or who is this guy?) I\\'ve been a touring and competitive cyclist for a long time (over 30 years off and on). I\\'ve been on two-three week cross country rides covering 100-150k per day, as well as racing both road and mountain. I\\'ve cycled in a lot of different conditions on a lot of different bikes.

       "    'body': \"You don't say anything about the climate and ascent/descent involved, but assuming an average mountain trail 160 miles (260 km) should be doable in a single push. I don't think there's any magic solution to this - it's simply applied common-sense. The main issue is the extra food you have to carry without resupply - around 1kilo/2.2lbs per day on trail plus a bit extra for safety. First, get fit so you can cover the ground fast First and foremost, I would suggest you get well trained before you go. This means you can travel fast and carry less food, keeping your pack-weight more reasonable. Get going at first light and walk steadily till dusk. Start slow and finish strong, keeping plenty of energy in hand. Strong walkers would aim to average well over 20 miles (32 km) a day on mountain trails in summer conditions - this is a typical pace for anyone tackling trails like the AT or the PCT so it's doable if you're trained. Even if you only manage 20 miles (32 km) a day, you should cover 160 miles (260 km) in a maximum of 8 days. Fast walkers would complete a trip like this in 5-6 days. If the weather in your area is volatile, you need to allow an extra day or two in case you get storm-bound. Second, minimise your base weight If you want to cover distance, you'll probably want to prioritise lightness over comfort. So you should reduce your base pack weight as far as your skill and experience allows without compromising safety. For example, if conditions allow you might want to take a tarp rather than a tent. Third, pack calorie-dense food Then you'll want to pack calorie-dense food with a high fat content. It's reasonable to aim for an average of around 120 calories per oz (18 MJ/kg), or even higher if you're prepared to eat a lot of fats such as peanut butter or olive oil. As an average sized male carrying a pack all day on a steep trail you'll be burning around 4000-5000 calories (17-21 MJ) daily. To maintain your weight, you'd have to carry 5000/120 = 42 oz (1.2 kg) of food per day. Most people feel this is too much, and carry around 2.2 lbs (1.0 kg) of food per day (or less if they're small and light). On long trails they re-feed in the trail towns to maintain their weight. On a relatively short walk like this, you would lose a little body-fat. If you have body-fat to spare, you could safely under-eat by an additional 500-1000 calories (2.1–4.2 MJ) a day, so you'd lose a few lbs from your belly during your walk, reducing your pack weight by a few lbs. It's important to trial this on day-walks or weekenders before committing to a bigger walk, so you know how much food you need to keep you happy on the trail.\",\n",

It\\'s an expansion on a link he referenced in his second picture, which seems to perfectly fit the criteria you\\'re seeking. The organization is called Rail Explorers . They provide guided tours you can take in a safe environment, with no investment or experience necessary. All equipment is included, and tailored to the number and ages of people using it. The following information is taken from the various pages of their website. About Rail Explorers: Rail Explorers is a company that is passionate about sharing the fun and adventure of riding the rails. We provide a unique way of experiencing the outdoors in a safe, relaxed and enjoyable way. The bikes, called Explorers, are different than true bicycles, and even true rail bikes, such as the bikes that serious riders like Ken Graham use. They have no handlebars, but they do have pedals and breaks. What is a Rail Explorer? A rail explorer is a pedal powered vehicle that rides on railroad tracks. They have 4 steel wheels, hydraulic disc brakes, pedals for each seat, and are comfortable, fun and easy to ride. Although the rail explorers require pedaling, the magic of steel wheels on steel rails makes the experience very different from riding a regular bicycle. There is no need to carefully watch the road ahead, there is no need to steer and riding is hands free - making it easy to take photographs and video as you roll along. Choose either the Tandem Rail Explorer (2 seats) or Quad Rail Explorer (4 seats) for your ride. Single rider \\'Jumpseats\\' are also available. (Pictures of the different models can be found here ). Who can ride the Rail Explorers? Everyone! Rail explorers are suitable for all ages and abilities - the elderly, families, couples, cyclists, non-cyclists, hikers and couch potatoes. As it says, it really is a true family experience. Children of all ages are welcome in the Explorers with enough seats so that they can be individually strapped in. Infants are allowed, and are strapped to adults using harnesses which are provided. You can even bring small dogs, if they\\'re on a leash! Each tour has a guide on their own bike in the front and in the back. They travel only on tracks without any trains, and have coordinated with local authorities to make sure no other vehicles are on the road during their hours of operation. Explorers are instructed to spread out, and are not allowed to pile up on one another, or \"tailgate.\" That way you can feel somewhat on your own. Tours run in all weather, as long as it\\'s safe, and each bike comes with an umbrella! Trips are one-way, but they include a free shuttle bus back to the parking lot. The company is committed to what they call \"Green eco-tourism\" meaning the bikes have no emissions; and because they use established trails, no trees, land or wildlife are disturbed to create the opportunity. This is obviously true of all Rail Biking, and another good reason to give it a try. As @Charlie Brumbaugh found, Rail Explorers currently has a location in the Adirondacks Region of New York. Within the next few months, they\\'ll also be opening another New York location, in the Catskill Mountains, and one in Rhode Island. At the very least, this should be fun for your family vacation. Since your husband is already a bike rider, though, this might be just what he needs to encourage him to try altering one of his bikes, or purchasing something specifically designed for this purpose. Then he can get the \"true\" experience. Lists of local rail trails are easy to find on line, but I\\'m not sure if Rail Biking is allowed everywhere. There are authorities who can be contacted to learn that information. Here are some fun pictures from people enjoying the ride. Click on them for bigger views.',\n",

In running, cycling, and mountaineering, cumulative elevation gain refers to the sum of every gain in elevation throughout an entire trip. It is sometimes also known as cumulative gain or elevation gain , or often in the context of mountain travel, simply gain. Elevation losses are not counted in this measure. Cumulative elevation gain, along with round-trip distance, is arguably the most important value used in quantifying the strenuousness of a trip. Cumulative elevation gain So in your example, it would be 500+100+400 = 1000m of elevation gain but a change in elevation of 500m. Sometimes on say the Keyhole route up Longs Peak there is very little difference between the elevation gain and elevation change since you are going up the whole time. Personally, when I do it, I focus on just once hill at a time and so the difference in that situation is negligible.\",\n",

For the former you can train by running or biking for fitness and core strengthening exercises for the strength. Especially for the core, don\\'t do only those exercises that are recommended to make a good looking sixpack as they only train the outer core muscles while the main core strength comes from the inner core muscles that aren\\'t that highly visible. Also I would prefer running over cycling in this case as you have to carry your upper body which also trains the stamina of your core muscles whereas you are in a much more \"suspended\" position while cycling, so that you don\\'t have less training effect for the core muscles. For the stress endurance: under long distance cyclists it is said that one the most important preparations is lots of saddle time to get your butt used to the continuous stress. It is quite the same with the backpack on your shoulders. You can just pack the whole trekking pack (not necessarily the whole equipment, but about the same weight and weight distribution) when you go on a day hike every now and then to get your back and shoulders used to the load.

These area in themselves are often quite tranquil and pretty. Get to the top of a climb, clip in and lookout, the views are often spectacular, even on the little 10 - 20m routes I climb. Length of route This doesn't apply as much to bouldering. The highest artificial climbing wall is ~40m , with the average gym probably in the 15m - 20m range. Outside, the sky is almost literally the limit. Single pitch climbs of 50m are not unheard of with 20 - 30m quite common. This introduces a new level of endurance, and the mental aspect of overcoming the height, particularly on exposed routes. String a few of these together as a multi-pitch route and you'll find yourself climbing literally hundreds of meters on single route. Making a day of it Sure sometimes you need a quick climbing fix, and gyms fit this need perfectly. Sometimes you want a whole day adventure. My regular outdoor spot is about 2hrs drive away. We generally get on the road around 7am stop for breakfast around 8am and hit the crag around 9:30. We spend the drive variously catching up on life and talking about the day ahead, potential routes etc so the drive isn't wasted and builds the hype. We climb till about 3-4 with a lunch break some time in there. We'll then have a beer (hopefully still cold) before walking back to the car.

Pick destinations that excite you, even if they're a little harder to get to or feel slightly outside of your comfort zone. Always bring a headlamp. Always bring a lightweight windbreaker. The first serious symptom of overexertion is an inability to stay warm. Always bring an assortment of snacks (50 calories per hour, assortment of fatty, sweet, and salty options). Running with friends is always more fun (not to mention safer). If you're driving to your destination, leave some cozy clothes, water, and a big snack in the car. You will thank yourself. If you invest in one piece of gear, make it a solid running pack. The Salomon S-Lab Adv Skin 5Set is (in my opinion) the best thing on the market by a wide margin.

My greatest bike ride so far was from Zürich to Bern (145km/90m) which I managed in a single day, so I expect to be able to do around 80-100 km each day. So I think I should be able to make it to Vancouver in less than a month. I've read a handful of blogs from people who did it, so the idea isn't quite as outlandish as it first seemed. I'm mostly looking for information about camping spots, emergency situations, necessary equipment, further sources of information and just general tips and tricks. Here's what I've planned so far: 1 CHF = 0.98 USD Fly from Basel to Whitehorse and from Vancouver to Basel - totaling at around 1500CHF (including bike). I plan to spend around 1000CHF for the entire trip (25k total). I have a city/mountain bike hybrid that is made to be easy to fix. I plan to carry around 3-4kg in a backpack and maybe 4-5 in saddlebags. I think I'll only pack as much food as necessary and stock up along the way. I should be able to reach some form of settlement every 2 days. I speak fluent English and some French. The Temperatures seam pretty bearable at 11° degrees in July. I'm going to be alone. I'm planning to sleep in a tent most of the times. I'll probably stay as close to the road as possible. Here're some of the stuff I am worried about: Is there a better Forum for trips like this? Wild animals (bears, buffaloes, elk), which precautions are necessary? Are they known to attack unprotected travelers? Do they keep off the road? Are the prices somewhat reasonable? In Switzerland you get robbed along the highways. Is the road kept in shape for bikers? Do I have to watch out for reckless drivers? Is there a danger of highway robbery? How quick do emergency services respond? Is camping along the highway even legal? Alternatively, are there enough camping grounds? Online research has been inconclusive. Is it even safe to travel alone, or should I look for a friend to join me? Is there cellphone coverage up there? Is there a way to get Internet? These are just some of the worries of the top of my head, I'm sure there are more. So are there people who have done similar things? I'd love to get in contact. Where should I look for more Information? I'm mainly looking for the exercise and some scenery.

Now, if you just traversing a mountain and not actually getting on the top of it, then you may not have much of a choice.

I left Puerto de la Cruz about 7.30 in the morning, drove to the little Montana Blanca car park (there is a small notice board to confirm where you are), did the climb of 4,500' or so up past the Altavista quite straightforwardly, back down the same way and was back in Puerto de la Cruz by about 7.00 in the evening. Above the Altavista I took it at more of a plod, and stopped for a wee breather every 5 - 10 minutes; breathing is definitely affected up here, but I didn't have any of the severe headaches, sickness and disorientation I had on Mt Blanc. Back at the hotel, I felt great, had a shower, then started a beer; I couldn't finish it; went straight to bed, had a poor nights sleep, didn't feel at all well the next day, couldn't eat, and only started getting back to normal the day after that - all absolutely classic altitude after-effect symptoms. One other minor complication doing it this way is getting the right permit time slot for the summit; I actually arrived at the checkpoint about 1/2 hour before the start of my slot, but the guard let me through after my best pleading look.

       "    'body': \"No you should not use a bicycle helmet for climbing. They are designed for different types of impacts and will not provide you with proper protection outside of their designed activity. Bicycle helmets are designed for a SINGLE ground impact. Like modern cars they are designed to crumple and absorb the energy from an impact. They probably provide the best protection of any type of helmet because of this design. Once they've had an impact they are now completely useless though. This is not a big deal after a bike accident as you can probably stop riding the bike and walk or get a ride home. Climbing helmets on the other hand are designed for multiple impacts. They do not absorb impact energy like a bicycle helmet but they can provide protection even after an impact. This is important when you're climbing because unlike biking you can't always stop climbing just because you've had an accident. You've got to complete your ascent or return to the ground. Additionally, most head injuries from climbing are not from the climber falling but rather from rocks falling on their heads from above. So imagine you've worn your bike helmet to climb and managed to bang your head on the wall. The bike helmet is crumpled now and will provide no protection now. Suddenly some rocks fall from above. You would be severely injured as the bike helmet would not absorb the impacts or even deflect very well at this point. Added 5/28/12 You can't really compare the standards as they are for different activities and requirements. As stated above the cycling helmet standards do not require multiple impacts. EN climbing helmet testing is done under EN 12492: 2000 and these tests require multiple impacts to the helmet. Specifically a 5kg hemispherical striker is dropped at 30 and 120 degrees (from the horizontal plane) on the top of the helmet from a height of 2 meters. A flat 5kg striker is then hit on the front, sides, and rear of the helmet. There are also penetration tests done. The maximum force that can be transferred to the head 10kN. So climbing helmets are not designed to absorb as much of an impact. They are designed for multiple impacts of smaller force instead. I am not as familiar with bicycling helmet standards, just that their design does not require multiple impacts. If you've ever seen a cycling helmet after a ground impact you can see clearly it would not provide protection for a second impact. Rather, they are designed to absorb much higher levels of force by crumpling. CPSC standards permit only 3kN of force to be transferred to the head. I'm not sure what weight and how they test this though. So the short version is that a cycling helmet must not transfer more than 3kN of force while a climbing helmet may transfer up to 10kN. There are many more standards setting bodies for cycling helmets as well. I only used the CPSC because it's the most common one on the market. Snell has a much more stringent standard. I have seen some of the foam climbing helmets but I'm not sure what the design theory is behind them. I suppose they would absorb more impact from any single impact. Once the foam has been impacted it would not provide that level of absorption again though. The shell of the helmet would still need to meet the multiple impact requirements to be approved by EN. The other issue is that most cycling helmets have fairly wide ventilation slits. These are far to large for climbing and could easily allow falling rocks to penetrate to the head. There are now some multi-sport helmets on the market but these are intended for climbing, canyoneering, and kayaking/rafting. Cycling and motoring helmets will always require higher absorption levels because higher speeds (and thus force) are involved.\",\n",

Imagine this, lay out a path. One is two giant steps, almost like someone stacked two big boxes that you have to climb to get up 5 ft. Then for 50 ft you get to walk in a straight path. Now, instead of the initial two big boxes, you instead have to walk 50 ft with a steady incline. The whole time you are walking you will be exerting more work on your body with less recovery time. What you are experiencing is normal. Your body may need to do short bursts on trail B, but you get to recover on the flat areas for a larger portion of time. On trail A, it's like you are on a constant uphill climb with no way for your body to recover on a flat plane surface. Your leg muscles are constantly working to increase your elevation. For your second point. For both, always stretch. It will keep you loose and drink lots of water, especially on trail A. For trail A, eat a long burning carb like oatmeal. It will help keep you going on the trail. Mentally you need to be prepared for the long haul. Keep a deep steady breath. Breath in through the nose and out through the mouth. Take breaks regularly and let your body rest if you are feeling too fatigued. But mentally, accept the fact that path A is just going to be more strenuous and that when you finish, you just accomplished a nice steady workout (helping your heart and endurance). For path B since you are doing sharp increases in elevation, stretching is really important. You will be more prone to injury with quick thrusts on your muscles. About 30 min before a quick change in elevation, eat an apple/banana to give you some quick energy for that sharp increase that will burn fast. After you do the sharp climb, take a small break (2 min) and stretch. Then proceed on the level areas at a steady pace to keep your muscles warm. When you get done with both, stretch again and take nice deep breaths. Drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration. On a side note, if you want your hikes to feel more like relaxation instead of exercise, it's best to just get yourself in better shape. If you make sure your physical activity when you exercise is more strenuous than when you hike, hiking will be a much less demanding activity on you and will feel like a day in the park compared to your regular workout routine.

       "    'body': \"I'll try to give a fairly generic answer to this broad question... Avoid Dangers This is obvious really, but first and foremost you'll want to avoid any kind of routes which lead you close to dangers. What's dangerous and what isn't and which levels of danger you'll be prepared to accept will depend highly on your skill level, your environments/weather, the mountain in question, etc. Avoid scrambles/climbs if possible (unless that is your actual goal obviously, in which case you should be properly equipped). Avoid passing steep ice/snow fields/glaciers . For many of those you need special skills and special equipment. Don't cross streams if avoidable. Try to avoid crossing ravines/mountainsides where rockfall is frequent. If you do have to cross do so quickly and alertly. Try to avoid spending time beneath cliff sides, as rockfall is always a danger and there is virtually no warning signs in such a case. Forests are generally quite safe to walk through (trees will protect you against rockfall, will protect the soil from eroding, etc.), but depending on the type of forest can be horribly uncomfortable and inefficient to pass. Avoid long wet grass, or more generally, anything slippery on long unbroken inclines. Generally walking on top of ridges will be fairly safe, unless the drop-off towards both sides is very steep and sudden. (In which case it can become a dangerous climb or scramble.) Efficiency Different countries/regions have different practices when picking paths up steep inclines. In my experience this depends a lot on whether the route was ever used economically (e.g. travel up to mountain pastures with your livestock, or cross a pass to bring goods to market) vs. purely 'recreational' routes. I find the former to use more serpentines, where as recreational routes can be very steep/hard ascends. Personally I find it more efficient to pick a zig-zag/serpentine path up an incline - unless it is not very steep. This will allow me to keep a decently fast pace when ascending without getting exhausted quickly. But of course serpentines are a tradeoff of time vs. exhaustion . If time is more valuable, then by all means, ascend in the straightest possible line. Don't lose altitude once gained. E.g. no descends and re-ascends on the way up if possible. If you need to move around obstacles big or small, try to keep your altitude by moving along the hillside. Avoid forests if you don't rely on them to keep you out of harms way. Picking a path through a forest can be quite arduous and the same goes for scrubs, thickets and the like. Avoid bogs and moors. While they generally won't suck you down just like in the movies they can be hell to navigate and traversing one often takes a lot more energy than simply going around. Fauna and Flora As always when following leave no trace be aware of your environment and the ecosystem you are moving in. If you happen to stumble upon any nests/dens, feeding places or generally herds of animals of any kind give them a wide berth. Be mindful of where you pick your path, as the mountain flora can be especially fragile due to the short growth periods. Avoid walking on raised bogs , as they will take a lot of damage from your steps. Be mindful of flowers growing in mountainous ecosystems. At least in alpine regions many of them are protected (e.g. Edelweiss , Silver Thistle , Alpine Rose , etc.).\",\n",

You\\'re much more likely to get yourself killed climbing dynamically on an exposed alpine route.

Do you really have the equipment and experience to cope? If need be, can you handle extreme heat, wet or cold? Navigation : How hard is it to find the route? This can vary hugely. Even on marked trails you'll sometimes come across a baffling junction. If need be, can you navigate the route in cloud, dark and storm? Emergency : If you get into trouble, how hard would it be to get help? Does your party have the experience to extract yourselves in case of illness or accident? River Crossings : These can be lethal. Do you have the skill and judgement to keep safe? Snow and Ice : What can you expect to encounter? You can't always see this from the valley. If you have any doubt about your ability to cope, ask locally about current conditions. Bears and other wild animals : Do you know the local regulations? Do you know what precautions to take? Over the years, most of the issues I've seen in the hills have stemmed from a party underestimating the route or overestimating their skills. Sometimes this can be quite extreme: I once had to help rescue a lady who was attempting Ben Nevis in full winter conditions and a gathering blizzard while shod in high-heel shoes!

On the hike it became apparent that I was the strongest hiker carrying a big bag, the reason being that out of everyone in the group, I had spent my youth carrying big bags on long hikes. The others were athletic, but had trained their bodies to perform during different activities. That being said, on another occasion when I took a group of boys out backpacking there was one 17 year old boy who had never carried a bag in his life, but was heavily involved in team sports. He stormed the trail like nothing could slow him down leaving everyone else in his dust, and did it without breaking a sweat. To add insult to injury he did it wearing an old pair of gym sneakers.

More to the point, I interspersed that riding with rest days (when I took public transport instead). Cycling every other day (e.g. Monday, Wednesday, Friday), or two days followed by a rest (e.g. Monday and Tuesday but not Wednesday) might be a good beginning. Especially if your feet are clipped to the pedals (e.g. using SPD shoes) it\\'s possible to get some wear if your fit is wrong: with a 90 RPM cadence, a 1 hour ride each way implies 10,000 cycles per day -- so a lot of repetition.

Then they are joined by two athlete friends who are in hard marathon training. The two fairly unfit blokes who have trained in the Alps proceed to walk the runners into the ground for the next few days till their friends build up their Alpine conditioning. I think that one of the main lessons from research is that training is very specific. Beyond basic endurance conditioning, I find that nothing helps to prepare me for carrying a pack up and down steep hills nearly as well as carrying a pack up and down steep hills - you'll be using muscles that simply aren't engaged so much in other sports. The carry-over from flat-surface running and from cycling might be less than you hope for. Though I disagree with the poster who advised against anything intense - the benefits of HIIT seem to be so pervasive that it surely plays a role in any conditioning programme if done in moderation with ample recovery time. In the hope of getting the best carry over, I use hill-sprints. Stair climbing with a pack or weight vest might be worthwhile if you can't get to the hills. I've also found benefit in squats and lunges with low reps - building the strength of the support muscles helps with endurance, I find, especially with long descents. But perhaps the most important advice is to schedule some time at the start of your holiday for progressive training climbs to acclimatise to the altitude and specific physical demands of Alpine work.

But for a very long hike, training is somewhat secondary as you'll gain fitness on trail. If training is not mandatory, I think experience almost is: you should definitely go sleep in the wilds prior to your departure. You have to know your needs and start deciding which gear you'll carry. Lightweight is key. You should aim for a baseweight (everything on your back without food or water) of 6kg or less. It might seems low, but as you don't have yet the gear it should be doable. You should check ultralight backpacking forums and see their gear lists. Following the previous point: the lightweight gear is the one you don't carry. No need to carry 4 shirts or 3 pants. You'll stink, but every hiker stink and that's about it. Specifically for the GR5: North to south is the easiest and logical way to do it (easy start and amazing finish), but then you need to start between May and July in order to be finished before first snow. It is logistically easy, at least before the Alps. You can often resupply or buy stuff. As you can easilly complete your gear, if you wonder if you should take something with you: don't, and buy it or make someone send it to you along the way. It is easier to assess what you really need this way. The GR5 is mostly easy and you don't need to worry too much about logistics. No need to purchase expensive guides or maps: a GPX track on your phone and a spreadsheet with all the resupply points with distance and elevation and you're good to go. Then, how long does it take? It is really hard to answer that question as it will depend on how you want to tackle the route. It you follow the official stages, it might be 3.5 mounths. If you decide that you want a challenge, you can try to go faster. As it is a long way, it is quite easy to go faster as you progress; you should plan for shorter days at the beginning (20ish km) and then try to cover more. If you read about thru-hiking in the US, you'll see that they often average more than 35km/day. I did the GR5 in the Alps and I was averaging 30km and 2000m of elevation per day. Then I discovered the thru-hiker mindset (basically: hike all day long), and now I average 40+km/day. Hiking is great because it's not technical: going faster or further is mostly a matter of motivation.\",\n",

I also keep a bunch of shoulder length runners with a single biner like Steph Davis . If the route looks really crazy you might even need to extend a piece with a double shoulder length sling. There is no really good way to deal with that, but different color clings and having them go the other way helps. Places like J-Tree are a real challenge because sometimes the cracks are splitter like Bird of Fire and sometimes they slant or wander all over the place like Illusion Dweller . Since most of the routes are short, you can sometimes plan ahead.',\n",

       "    'body': 'Adding on to the other excellent answers, here would be a few of my additional tips: Try to pay more attention to the difficulty of a hiking trail before committing to running it. Consider working your way up by running on forest service roads and flat trails before moving to more mountainous trails. Trail etiquette is even more important. Announce your presence in safe locations when you want to overtake a slower group of hikers; don\\'t run full tilt around corners. That there\\'s no shame in walking cannot be overstated enough. Always keep in mind that \"getting to the summit is optional; getting back is mandatory.\" This brings us to... Give some thought to how quickly a minor problem can escalate. A twisted ankle, blisters, running out of water, or an afternoon thunderstorm can be very problematic if you find yourself miles from the trailhead with minimal gear. Always let someone know where you\\'ll be and when you plan to return! One piece of gear that I highly recommend is an ultra-light wind-breaker such as the Patagonia Houdini or Mountain Hardwear Ghost Lite . These jackets pack down incredibly small (I\\'ve fit mine in the sewn pocket on a hand-bottle) and provide just enough protection to keep you moving if adverse weather rolls in. I like to bring along a couple Katadyn Micropur Purification Tablets on a run. Much lighter than carrying a second bottle of water, work reasonably fast, and can help prevent running out of water (provided that you can find a stream). Consider getting shoes designed specifically for trail running. In comparison to road runners / sneakers, trail running shoes generally offer more stability, more impact protection, aggressive tread, and stickier rubber. Again, breaking a toe or a slip-and-fall can be more consequential when you\\'re running in the mountains.',\n",

If you sweat going uphill in the sun, just make a 30 second stop, drink something and pack that extra layer in the backpack. Try not to sweat too much, because sweating makes you cold! It is great to use the layering system where you are able to adjust very fast to the conditions and you will therefore always stay comfortable. Besides that I suggest to carry a second pair of gloves and even take two items for the head. Just in case it gets wet (very likely for the gloves) and you can even use the layering system for those items. In cold conditions you described I bring a balaclava with me.

Horses are prey animals and may be sensitive to potential threats from above them, and may also be confused by people wearing large backpacks. (They also tend to bolt uphill when spooked.) Allow them all to pass, keeping in mind that less-experienced or problem horses are likely to be placed last in line. I also suggest giving the rear of any horse a wide berth.

You'll need a skin will cover nearly the whole ski base, and that won't slide easily at all (I think my skins require more than 10° of slope to go downhill). Because of that friction, you will not experience much that resembles cross country skiing, except for maybe some skating type action. Without skins the skis will give you no grip, you'll have to use poles & skating to go anywhere. Ideally your route will not have any long flat sections. A skill you might work on is going uphill with all that weight on your feet. You won't need to lift your foot for every step, as long as the skis tips stay on top of the snow, so that's just a matter of exercise. You will probably have to change direction on steep slopes, meaning lift one ski out, turn it ~180° then transfer your weight onto it, while your poles are sinking into that bottomless powder. This can get quite awkward and a little frustrating, so I'd practice that before committing to a long day in the back country. For the downhill part, you'll get conditions similar to groomed snow during the spring, which is easy enough. Depending on where you are you might get deep powder, very chunky sun cups, avalanche debris that's like rubble, or inch-thick ice. You can practice skiing those while in-bounds, if your local ski resort isn't too obsessive about grooming. As ab2 said, get some avalanche training, and find out about your local avalanche forecast. Get a beacon and practice using it, some ski areas will offer clinics on beacon use.

I run into more bears when I'm on my mountain bike than when I'm hiking. Large predators use trails as often as people do. If you're not making enough noises to identify yourself as human, then you might not give the wildlife enough notice to get off of the trail ahead of you. While trail running, you're typically concentrating on breathing and don't talk a lot, you're also focused on the trail, so you yourself are often unaware of what's on the trail not far ahead. Most of the time the bears will startle and run off the trail, but if you're cruising along, and round a corner right up behind a grizzly bear, it could act defensively. This is the scenario where you would play dead, the bear might paw at you for a bit, but if you play dead it'll figure it's taught you your lesson and then wander off. Black bears are completely different. If you play dead with them there is a chance they're figure they just scored a free meal and start eating you. With black bears you either have to scare them off, or fight them off. Both scenarios are rare. Best thing to do is to sing while you run alone or shout down the trail occasionally. But it's always advisable to run with a partner, someone you can talk to while you run, and who can help you tag-team intimidate a bear if you encounter one. They sell small cans of bear spray at the till in the markets in the mountain towns. It might be wise to pick one up and run with a water pack to carry it in just to be extra safe, but I can pretty much assure you that 99.9% of the time the bear will wander off to a safe distance. That safe distance is quite a bit shorter in national parks however, bears are quite more accustomed to people there. For the most part you don't need to worry about bears. You may see some, thousands of people do in the Rockies, especially in national parks. Enjoy your runs, just make sure you know what to do in the unlikely event of a dangerous encounter.\",\n",

I imagine that 3 times 3000 m would be inconvenient because of temperature differences, and 89 times 100 m would be a burden for the brain. What other factors should I take into account?

Most of the roads in Rocky Mountain National Park can be traveled by ordinary passenger cars, at least when it's not snowy. The roads in the nearby national forests vary widely. The main forest roads can be traveled by ordinary passenger car, but a more capable car will give you access to more places. If you want to maximize your ability to access lots of different trailheads, particularly in the more remote parts of the National Forests, you want something with high ground clearance and all-wheel drive. I've been on many remote forest roads throughout AZ, NM, UT and CO, both with passenger cars and high ground clearance all wheel drive vehicles. There is a lot you can get to with just a passenger car. If I had to pick between high ground clearance and all-wheel drive, I'd definitely choose the high ground clearance. In pratise, one usually comes with the other though. The roughness of some of the roads is much more of a issue than getting stuck due to lack of traction. In some cases I was in a high ground clearance vehicle that had to be manually switched into all wheel drive. While I did that in a few cases, most of the time it wasn't worth the trouble and possibility of forgetting to switch back to two wheel drive when getting to a paved road. You can go a lot of places with a ordinary car if you're careful and are willing to stop, get out, look at the road, and plan your route. I've actually re-arranged rocks in a stream bed to be able to drive over it in a passenger car. Snow on the road totally changes the tradeoffs. Lots of back country roads are closed in winter instead of being maintained. Unless you have a snowmobile, you'll have to get out and ski or snowshoe them anyway. If you want to go as far as you can with a car in winter, definitely get chains and a vehicle that can do all wheel drive.

       "    'body': 'GENERAL CONDITIONING As @ap2 has said training is quite task-specific, so the priority for hiking hills with a heavy pack is to get out as much as possible and hike hills with a heavy pack. You want to incrementally increase your speed and the ground you cover - but listen to your body and don\\'t push yourself to the point of injury. Failing that, climb stairs, but this is pretty boring so hit the hills if at all possible. One way to enjoy the maximum training effect from your hiking is wind-sprints. A couple of times during the day, blast up an ascent as hard as you can for 20-30 secs till you reach your maximum safe heart rate. Then walk on slowly till you catch your breath. Repeat 2-6 times, working up gradually, as this is demanding. Only do this a couple of times a week or you\\'ll overtrain. A second tactic is bouts of pushing hard with your walking poles to tire your upper body and get some cross-training effect as you would on an elliptical ergo or Nordic ski-trainer. In terms of general conditioning, a good deal depends on whether you are going northbound (NOBO) or southbound (SOBO). Going NOBO, the start is gentle and most hikers work up their mileage gradually as they find their hiking legs. Going SOBO you\\'re in big hills from the start, and speed is vital if you\\'re going to reach the Sierras before the autumn storms. So it\\'s more important to be in hard condition and ideally, to have spent a couple of days acclimatising to altitude before you hit the terminus. INJURY PREVENTION The other physical priority is injury prevention. The issues that are most likely to knock you off the trail are feet, ankles, knees and hips. I\\'m not going to go into detail here, but there are a lot of good bodyweight progressions on YouTube that will help you injury-proof your power train. Focus on good form. One thing you might miss though - recent research suggests that the best way to protect your ankles is to work on your balance. Search for \"sport balance training\". You could also take up slacklining. For training your feet (much neglected) search for \"Toe-ga exercises\". MENTAL PREPARATION To harden yourself mentally, be sure to go out in bad weather as well as good. Get used to spending multiple days on the trail in cold, rain and snow. If this puts you off, you\\'ll know that thru-hiking is probably not for you... SKILL TRAINING More generally, experienced hikers, Rangers and SAR experts are increasingly concerned about the number of PCT hikers who are woefully underprepared in terms of skills. The trail passes through big, remote mountains. Weather can be savage, and you mustn\\'t underestimate what you\\'re taking on. Hope for the best but prepare for the worst. You say you have backcountry experience so this may not apply to you. Though if you\\'ve mostly been in the woods, you should be aware that life above the treeline involves some additional skills. As this is literally a question of life and death, I\\'ll add a checklist for any hiking newbie who is contemplating any of the big trails. It\\'s vital that you become competent in: Navigating in bad conditions with map and compass, as well as GPS. Judging snow conditions and moving safely over steep, icy snow. Crossing fast-flowing streams (this is a significant cause of fatalities). Staying warm while walking in wet-cold conditions. Camping safely in cold, wet, wind and snow including cooking safely without burning yourself, your shelter or the surrounding forest. Personal hygiene on the trail to avoid gastric infections. Dealing with bears. And of course, a deep understanding of low-impact, leave-no-trace principles, as there are too many PCT hikers who are damaging the trail. You owe it to yourself, your family and to the SAR personnel to be as safe as possible on the trail. If you are a newbie contemplating one of the Triple Crown trails and don\\'t have the commitment to practice these skills before you go, perhaps you should be questioning your motivation. Hope you find this helpful - and perhaps we\\'ll meet on the trail!',\n",

In 2016, Pete Kostelnick ran 3,067 miles across the United States in 42 days, 6 hours and 30 minutes. In 2017, Sandy Villines ran 3126.52 miles across the United States in 54 days, 16 hours and 24 minutes. Every year, several people run across the United States. A typical pace for a run across the US is somewhere around 40 miles per day, necessitating 7 or 8 hours of running each day. Looking around the internet, it looks like 100+ miles per week on a bike is not unusual. This seems right because 100 miles per week is well known as a goal (from Lydiard) for runners. http://www.runeveryday.com/lists/USRSA-Active-List.html lists streak runners who have run at least one mile per day for some period of time. The top 60 active streaks are all greater than 30 years. Regarding any worries anyone might have about elderly bicyclists challenging themselves, Robert Marchand set an over 100 age group record in 2012 by biking 24.250 kilometers in an hour. On the advice of French physiologist Veronique Billat, he started training harder and improved this record to 26.927 kilometers in 2014. You may take some time to work up to 45 minutes biking, twice a day but this is well within human capabilities. My guess is that after doing this for some time, you will start going on longer rides on the weekends.',\n",

The uphill foot doesn't bury the lower foot. place your foot as close to flat as you can. At the least, place the entire uphill edge on the rock at once. Few of us have the ankle flexibility to place both edges flat on a side hill at the same time. You may find some benefit from retying your boot 2-3 hooks lower, and leaving the top more flexible for foot placement. Pull your outer sock down over the top to reduce scooping up samples. A walking stick on the lower side enables more deliberate placement of feet. Scan the route ahead frequently. It's easy to get wrapped up in the next 4 feet. You are looking for goat tracks, bigger scree. Check downslope too. Some scree slopes end on cliff tops. Sometimes you can make better forward progress by accepting some downhill travel. If there are multiple people in your party it may work better for each person to make their own trail, or to follow your trail. Put an experienced person at the back end.\",\n",

I don\\'t know what your body weights are, so I used 66 kg. The result of the estimate is that you burned 1240 calories climbing and 170 calories descending, for a total of about 1400 cal. The estimate is extremely sensitive to the slope. For instance, if I reduce the slope to 0.15, it reduces the result by 250 cal. This doesn\\'t take into account the packs you were carrying. There\\'s an app here from Hiking Science that tries to do that. Minetti\\'s numbers seem low by about a factor of 2 compared to other estimates I\\'ve seen.

Why the latter? Think about how most people hike - usually focused downward, a few feet ahead on the trail, watching their footing to try to avoid a face plant. If you\\'re headed downhill, you\\'ll generally see some distance ahead of you on the trail at the same time as you\\'re looking down to where you will set your feet the next step or two. You\\'ll see any hiker coming up hill well in advance of meeting. On the other hand, if you\\'re hiking uphill, and looking down at the trail, your range of vision is really just a few feet in front of you. Clearly the hiker going downhill has the visual advantage, and time, to adjust his position so the uphill hiker can pass. And, it\\'s a lot easier for the downhill hiker to stop and resume than it is for the uphill hiker. Think about the interstate trucker or you on a bike - it takes more energy and time to restore speed if starting from a dead stop. So it is with the uphill hiker, especially if carrying a backpack - let her come on through so she can benefit from the \"body in motion\" principle in physics. This applies to hikers running downhill too. And just because you\\'re running downhill (nobody is impressed anyway, and secretly hoping you face plant) that doesn\\'t give you the right of way. From Lowergear - Who has the \"Right-of-Way\"? Further citation: On a narrow pass, hikers going uphill have the right of way. Simply put, hikers moving uphill are generally working harder than those on the downhill slope. It is courteous to move to the side and let the uphill trekkers pass through. From Phoenix New Times - Hiking Etiquette It seems that many hikers—even experienced ones—may not know or always remember this, but hikers going uphill have the right of way. This is because in general hikers heading up an incline have a smaller field of vision and may also be in that “hiking rhythm” zone and not in the mood to break their pace. Often an uphill hiker may let others come downhill while they take a breather, but remember that’s the uphill hiker’s call. Form Co-Op Journal - Trail Etiquette',\n",

       "    'body': \"I have been an obsessive eastern peakbagger for almost a decade. That means a lot of the summits my partners and I now visit are lost extremely deep in the woods of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Quebec. Most of the summits I now climb are bushwhacks the entire way from the trailhead, and those trailheads are often along logging roads and trails that can vary in quality depending on how recent the logging has been in that particular area. Here's my experience with different types of vehicles in the backroads. First case: KIA Forte Hatchback I had been content with my daily driver for a few years, having been blocked by a washout only once (having to add 20km to the hike) and that was just because of the specific configuration of that washout. The main advantage to driving a FWD car with low clearance is that it will make you a proficient backroads driver. I had no other options other than finesse and wheel placement and this is more important than clearance only. That KIA has gone farther than some people with SUVs are willing to go. You can push a car pretty far without damage but where FWD cars will fail is when the road gets muddy and slippery or so rough that the rear wheels getting stuck in potholes will actually hinder the front wheels' grip. This summer I went through a really worn trail and at some point there was about 4 feet of air under the car in between the wheels on a badly eroded hill. You will certainly build confidence the more you drive. Second case: Modded Nissan XTerra Last year I bought a used Nissan XTerra with skid plate, 3” lift kit, and 31” tires. This is a really good offroad SUV with full 4X4 capabilities. It goes through anything. It turns out though that I never use the X. It costs too much gas money so I usually carpool with someone else if we’re going really deep. We usually convoy to the trailheads and if the road gets too rough for the least capable vehicles, we then pool up. Third case: Crossovers I have ridden in 3 different vehicles owned by other people. One of my friends has a Jeep Wrangler and while we can go pretty much anywhere with that, it’s as costly as my X to run. Another two of my friends each have last generation Subaru Outbacks, and this is the model that has impressed me the most. We have driven uphill (10%+ inclines) on completely washed out roads where nothing but watermelon-sized river rocks remain with minimal rubbing. Those vehicles are stock, no mods. Then there is one of my other friends who has a Subaru Crosstrek. That small crossover SUV is probably the most capable in its class. It has such good ground clearance straight out of the factory you can go really deep on disused roads without worry. If you get the version with the CVT and X-mode, it will go through horrible stuff easily. You can even get lift kits ( https://lpaventure.com/collections/crosstrek-2018/products/lp-aventure-lift-kit-subaru-crosstrek-2018 ). It has roughly the same gas mileage as other hatchbacks. So most definitely you don’t need to buy a full-on SUV. Some decent crossovers exist that can do the job and for the majority of trailheads, a regular car would do just fine.\",\n",

Not only will water make the rock slick, but the prominence and the metal cables make people on the route prime targets for lighting strikes. You are going to want to wear grippy shoes because of the slick granite and gloves to protect your hands. What you are going to want to do to prevent a catastrophic fall is to clip yourself in to the cables. The minimum equipment for that is a rock climbing harness and a via ferrata setup. A rock climbing helmet would also be a good idea. The caribiners will need to be regular sized (not mini). As you go up the cables, you will have one caribiner connected to the cable at all times. When you get to a post, clip the other caribiner onto the cable on the other side of the post, before removing the first. Like this. If you were to fall, the caribiner would slide until it caught on the post. With that said, you DO NOT want to fall, because of the risk of hitting some one else and knocking them down, potentially causing them to fall. The odds are very few people are going to be clipped in. Also, there is traffic going up and down at the same time so be mindful for other people. Making certain that you water bottles are secured inside your pack so that they can't fall out and hid someone else is also a good idea. Getting an early start will give you more time and allow you to take it slowly.

It takes a lot of physical and mental energy to move safely in these conditions - even the most benign snow slope can become treacherous with enough wind. If on the walk out 'get-home-itus' can make you push harder than you might otherwise. The focus must be on the amount of effort you are putting in, not how much (little) you think you should be. I have seen a climber picked up and blown 20 meters by a foehn wind. It does not matter how good a climber you are - if you lifted off the ground the outcome is always going to be down to luck. If the wind is lifting you, you need to consider if you are safe. If not you can then rope up and use a running belay, maybe even a full belay. Worst case is to dig in and wait it out, but make you this decision is made early enough for a successful shelter to be built or found. As far as carrying on, roped or unroped, you need to reduce your wind profile. If you are lucky you can choose a route that allows you to descend with you back to the wind - it will be fast, easy and with the wind no longer in your eyes, you can see where your going so much safer (I have done this and ended up on the opposite side of the mountain from my car and overnight gear, but alive). If you have to climb down into the wind, face into it (Unless no pack, then side on is a lower profile). Squat down rather than lean back or forward. Listen for wind gusts and when you hear one coming, get low quickly, as the gust dies down, move on. Have your ice axe ready at all times and use it for stability. I have ended up crawling for about 100 meters,(which got me to a lee slope). Look for terrain that provide shelter from the wind, but be very wary of lee slopes and assess avalanche risk (all too easy to forget in the joy and relief of getting out the wind).\",\n",

       "    'body': 'Aligning the answer strictly for Kilimanjaro, I\\'d first recommend you to select the route that you are going to take. If you want to take the easiest way up, the Marangu route shall be perfectly suitable for you (No offence, just in case if you remain unprepared, if you have been preparing well, you might try the other routes. I\\'d consider taking two different routes: One for ascent and the other for descent). You\\'d probably wanna take care of permits required, if there are any. Once you are on field there, the thing you must be watchful for is Acclimatization. This little part \"how to get started with something like this\" makes me add the below part to the answer. As far preparing for the higher scale of mountaineering goes, as you predominantly mentioned that you have been doing Day hiking, it should get easier. 1. Strength building and Load Carrying : Mountaineering doesn’t require outright power-lifting skills, nor it requires a well-gymmed body, or weight-lifting ability, but it does require a fair bit of strength in limbs and shoulders. You’re not just climbing the mountain, but also also probably hauling a large and heavy pack on your back and your body needs to be able to move with that extra weight. As you have been doing day hikes, as assume you are aware of how to walk the mountains. You\\'ll need to practice carrying much a bigger backpack, and still be able to cover the distance. For that you\\'ll need stamina. 2. Increasing the stamina: Unlike one day hikes, you are not going to scale down a mountain in an hour or two, so increasing your stamina is a huge piece of training for mountain climbing. Being able to keep moving and alert for hours is a key skill for mountaineers. Exercises such as stair climbing (may be with a pack?) and hiking steep terrain are great for working those lower body parts. Even Cycling and Swimming helps to develop stamina. 3. List down the things to pack and way they are packed: I suggest preparing a list of the things that you do not want to miss out when you are on the mountain. There is wide range of the things and in initial days I used to forget on or the other. Its always rightly said that, \"I\\'d always prefer to carry a thing that I may not use up there, but I would rather not prefer not having it when I need it\". e.g. A Flashlight on a day hike? We always plan to finish the activity before sunset, we most of the time do. What if we don\\'t? So, list down the things, and pack them as you need them. Things which you may need more frequently, you should have them packed in a manner that they are easily accessible. The bulky and light stuff should go at the bottom of the pack. This question here covers almost every bit about packing the backpack. 4. Get acquainted with necessary Gear and Equipment: Firstly, You\\'ll need a good backpack to put all the things into it. Get one that suits you. Get acquainted with the terms and the actual equipment that you may have to/want to use. For Kilimanjaro I think you may not need much of a equipment. Just a good backpack, a tent, a sleeping pad and a sleeping bag, a good footwear along with the regular stuff from your Day Hike packs will be more than enough. 5. Get Mad about it to get better: On a bad day at a Day hike you can be a bit harsh on you and keep going, and at the end of the day you\\'ll find yourself at home safe and sound. In multiday hikes, thats not the case. After a bad day, you may have to still keep going so that things don\\'t get worse. At the most, you\\'ll have a night in the tent or a mountain hut to recuperate in order to either turn back or go with the plan. You gotta fight tough times. And, Practice and Consistency are key to sustain mountaineering habits. It\\'s always easy to fall off the grid and loose the shape and stop doing the things. It\\'s rather difficult to keep going, keeping the hunger to go on and climb bigger mountains. For me the greediness to trek as much as can keeps me doing the stuff, and sideways, keep doing the stuff prepares me for bigger stuff. Just pat your back and keep it going! There are always new challenges to scale down. Have a good safe one!',\n",

Doing something vaguely aerobic that you enjoy doing for several hours at a stretch one or two times a week is far better than the \"optimal\" aerobic exercise that you never do. The best training for long days in the mountains is long days in the mountains. If you can\\'t do that for some reason, at least do long days. How much time you spend training is far more important than exactly what kind of training you do. There are adaptations your body makes that simply won\\'t happen in any kind of one hour or less workout. Building base endurance[1] requires at least one 3+ hr effort every two weeks or so. If you can recover in a week then 1x a week is good. I would avoid intervals and intensity, since they require recovery time and limit the long efforts you can do. What I would suggest is keep doing the things you enjoy, just gradually increase the length of time you do them. The one specific thing I would recommend is to spend as much time hiking with the pack, load and boots you plan to use on your trips as possible. There are lot\\'s of small control muscles that are hard to exercise in any other way than carrying your pack. You\\'ll also work out any pack fit issues. And well boots, there is nothing more important for a long day in the mountains than having well fitting, broken in boots.

You don\\'t want to dig out a shoe at that point. Especially in the mountains, learn to navigate. You have lots of clouds and fog and grey weather. You can get really lost in thick fog. And descending in the wrong valley can easily add a few hours to your trip. Look for the grassy lines when descending. Uphill the shortest way is usually the fastest. Downhill it is usually a grassy line, even if it is a lot longer and not following any path. Descending on grass you can really forget all breaks and feel the childlike feeling of yieeehaaaa. It is an amazing feeling. If you fall you were going too fast. If you don\\'t fall you can still go faster. At first, stick to paths or close to them, also on access land.

       "    'body': \"Listening to your body is good advise as others said: try to maintain relaxed, deep breathing, and when it becomes too much for you to do comfortable, you should slow down or stop to reset back to that. Relaxed in this case just means without tension or any struggle to breathe and get the air you need - climbing a mountain, breathing will be vigorous, but it can still be calm and under control. Someone else mentioned using a heart rate monitor - though I don't have experience with that, I imagine it can help like awareness of your own breathing. Differing from other answers thus far, I would recommend keeping distance goals based on the overall checkpoints planned on that day. Practicing with simple day hikes and easier backpacking trips certainly makes sense, and even in those cases you will have checkpoints you plan on, whether it's a half way point, a peak, your car, a camp site. In more elaborate trips you will have an understanding of the terrain and natural landmarks to guide you along the trail - practice good orienteering by checking your progress based on terrain, landmark, and trail based checkpoints; consider if your goals are in harmony with your progress or if you need to adjust. As you practice you'll get a feel for how to combine the above two paragraphs for you and even for your group so that you can make the best steady progress. You'll have some times you just stop to cool off and reset, but importantly you will begin to combine progress goals with your body's resting needs. For example, I'll make steady progress up to a point I've pre-determined on the map since the last time I stopped to check the map (and maybe even planned before I embarked on the trip). I'll get to the point I expected to arrive at, usually a mile marker or some natural landmark, and I'll check my time and how I'm progressing through my day's planned checkpoints. All the while, I'm returning to a very comfortable breathing rate, I'm making sure I'm hydrated and ready to go to the next checkpoint. In some cases, taking breaks as orienteering checkpoints also helps me recognize when I'm not on track, either because I'm not comfortable estimating my location to a spot on the map, or because I'm going too slow (or too fast) and should adjust my goals accordingly. Better to calmly realize and note these course adjustments needs ahead of time in calm conditions than later on with more pressure and potentially worsened conditions.\",\n",

I'd suggest anyone reasonably fit should be able to do anyone of these (up and down) in 3-4 hours (my fastest time up and down Snowdon is 2 hours). The hardest bit of the 3 peaks is the driving. Google thinks it's about a 10 hour drive so you're likely going to spend 9 hours walking and 10 hours driving. . Can you walk for 9 hours? Can you endure sitting in a car for 10?! :) I'd say this is possible for pretty much any fit and healthy person and 1000's complete it each year. But an increasingly large number are getting themselves into difficulty, mostly due to poor planning. Have a look though the various mountain rescue teams blogs and you'll see a lot of 3 peakers getting lost, etc. and having to be rescued by mountain rescue ( Llanberis MRT blog ). Many locals now dislike 3 peak teams due to some bad practices, always follow leave no trace ethics . Here's a brief checklist of what you should be prepared for/be aware of: I'd invest at least as much effort in the organisation side of the driving as I would in training for the walking. Be aware of daylight! Lots and lots of people get caught out by the sun going down. Know your route, have a map and compass with you. Make sure at least one member of your party is comfortable navigating in the hills potentially in the dark , especially this time of year (you've missed the longest days now). Injuries, carry a good first aid kit and be prepared to turn around if you need to. Parking, sounds silly but this time of year all 3 mountains are incredibly crowded. I know it's virtually impossible to park in Pen-Y-Pass (the closest car park to snowdon) pretty much any time of year. Ben Nevis is very remote and has very limited parking. So plan how you're going to get to the foot of the mountains. You may need to use public transport unless someone can drop you off and park further away. If you park badly expect a ticket (and possibly a shouting at from a disgruntled local) Plan toilet breaks. Don't defecate into the bushes, etc. For those interested a much more environmentally friendly version is the Yorkshire 3 peaks , no driving between the mountains. Just because the hills aren't as big doesn't make it easier BTW, I did this in training for the welsh 15 peaks ( more on my blog :) ) and it was pretty gruelling taking about 10 hours of solid walking.\",\n",

Your leg is bent when your foot touches the ground and you have to straighten it. This is a lot more work. Your distance is about 0.5% extra due to the slope. A standard stair has a rise over run of 7 over 10. Now you are going about 12% extra distance. Typical scree slopes are at the angle of repose -- about 35-40 degrees. Now you are going about 25% extra distance. This however is a bad way to look at it. Going up and down takes a lot more energy than traveling horizontally. When you are walking on slopes of 8% or lower, the biomechanics of your leg swing, and your stride length determine your speed. With some training you can lengthen your stride and increase your pace. Around 10% slope you have to use a different motion, that is less efficient, much higher energy. For most of us at 20% slope (steep hill) conversation is short phrases separated by puffs. (I knew one lad who could sing going up a 15% slope. He also played the bag pipe. Another could carry on a conversation at slopes and speeds I could do little more than grunt. He had planted trees on mountainsides for 5 months.) Coming down isn\\'t a lot better. Your muscles are not designed for absorbing energy. Coming down hill you often need to take time to pick your way. A long descent can leave you at the bottom with \"jello legs\" quivering from the effort of contracting under load. This too you can train for, but a stair climber machine doesn\\'t work. You have to go down slopes or stairs. For running trips in one sense I don\\'t care how far I really traveled. I want to have a good idea of what time it will take. So I have an estimater for the \\'effective distance of elevation change\\' In terms of planning distances I figure 5:1 for elevation. That is, a meter up effectively adds 5 meters horizontally. This is true for up and down both. In practice the up part takes longer for any but the most fit, but coming down is still slower than flat (you are picking your foot landing more carefully.) Both going up and going down you are taking shorter steps. So a 20 km loop route with a 1 km total of up and down will take about the same time, and leave the same fatigue more or less as a 25 km flat route. In more detail: 8% is a magic number in terms of gradients. Up to about an 8% grade (8 foot climb per 100 foot horizontal) you can walk normally. You have a heel strike. Your step shortens up hill and lengthens down hill. At 10% for most people, you change to a toe strike, and you are climbing, rather than walking. This is not nearly as efficient. You will find that the vertical change entirely determines your speed. E.g. when you are walking you do 3 km/hour. When your are climbing you do 1200 meters an hour up. Your numbers will vary.

Keeping going without stopping is harder than people think and I often hear people say about how far/fast they can go. Its always seems too fast and they are often clearly speaking from zero experience (based on their body fat percentages). Other factors are: climbing where 30 minutes a mile may be the best you can do, even descending steep slopes can be 20 min/mile because you have to pick your way down. Heat, humidity and fitness for the task are all factors (fitness being not just cardio and muscle conditioning, but also skin hardening on feet and areas that get chaffed).

Self-rescue techniques like ascending the rope apply equally to canyoneering. What do I do if I try to pull down the rope after a rappel and the rope gets stuck ... same as for climbing.

Fairly typically for the UK not much is written down. For example the Ramblers\\' Association guidelines for walk leaders mentions nothing of much use. The closest we have to anything definitive is the countryside code ; the Ramblers\\' interpretation of parts of this is helpful. Scrambling in particular tends to fall in the gaps between climbing (lots of written guidance and best practice, skill and kit required) and hiking (anyone can do it). There are some activity-specific guides which are worth a ride even if you\\'re just using the same space: The British Horse Society have some guidance on horses and bikes sharing space (with a focus on the road, but covering bridleways as well. British cycling have a video with some guidance which gives a nice insight into the general etiquette of sharing. There\\'s a nice summary, with some other aspects I hadn\\'t considered here . This is written from an international perspective but is all in agreement with UK practice.',\n",

       "    'body': \"My background: I am a mountain biker since 1986, and I have extensively used a dozen of different GPS devices on my mountain bikes since about 2003. From that perspective: According to each expert I have been talking to, and according to all literature I am aware of, the barometric measurement of the elevation is by far more accurate than the GPS-based measurement . The only disadvantage with the barometric measurement is that changes in air pressure can happen due to weather conditions, which may seriously disturb that kind of measurement. I always apply this method: When planning a trip with my MTB, I use a good map or other reliable source to get the precise elevation at the starting point. When actually starting the trip, I calibrate the altimeter to the correct elevation . I always have auto-calibration turned off completely. This has given me the best results in terms of the total ascent , which is the most important figure for me as a mountain biker (I know the total ascent of the whole trip; if I know the total ascent I have done so far, I can easily compute the total ascent to be done yet, and this finally is the figure which decides what to do in case of problems). The GPS-based auto-calibration is mainly for cases where the elevation drift due to weather changes and other phenomena which may affect the ambient pressure is not acceptable. As an example, elevation measurement on most of my devices is accurate to 2 m (reproducibility / absolute value); that is, when weather does not change, and I take the device on a round trip with several hundred meters of total ascent, it will show the same elevation when arriving at the starting point as it showed when departing from the starting point. On the other hand, when the weather changes, elevation readings before and after the change can differ by 100 meters and more. This is where auto-calibration comes into play. While GPS-based elevation measurement is very imprecise, it will still greatly improve things if you have no better idea about the correct elevation (or air pressure) (and hence can't calibrate the altimeter). You may have no such idea due to weather changes or because there are no maps or reliable elevation data available for the place in question. By the way, the auto-calibration is often misunderstood. For example, people expect that it works immediately after having turned on the device. But this is not true. Due to the problems of GPS-based elevation measurement, the device must wait a long time and must do excessive averaging and filtering before even thinking about calibrating the barometer. Furthermore, the device can only do that when reception conditions are good. The device reporting a GPS accuracy of 3 m does actually does not mean that a reasonable GPS-based elevation measurement is possible. As an example, I have read at several places (which I can't remember currently) that 20 minutes from turning on the device until the first GPS-based barometer correction is not unusual, even when the reception is good and the device has locked on to a lot of satellites. Having said this, and answering your actual question: On all Garmin devices I know (e.g. GPSmap 60xxx, 62xx, 64xx, 66xx, Oregon 6xx, 7xx, Montana 600xx, 610xx, Monterra, GPSmap 276cx) it is not possible to turn off the barometer . That wouldn't be wise anyway because it just is not possible to measure small elevation changes based on GPS , so the total ascent would be totally wrong on routes with many small descents / ascents. For a theoretical example, think of a route consisting of 20 descents of 10 m, each followed by an ascent of 10 m. So my first advice would be to calibrate the altimeter each time before beginning a trip. If you expect the weather to change, you can turn on the auto-calibration to let it compensate the drift which is solely due to changing air pressure and not due to elevation change; I don't know of any cases where auto-calibration seriously screwed up things. However, taking feelings into account instead of facts, I do not trust the auto-calibration. I haven't seen any documentation of about how it works, and I have seen too much silly software bugs in Garmin devices to consider their (probably outsourced) software development being capable of implementing such a complex feature without screwing it up. Therefore, I always turn it off and accept the error in my total ascent and absolute elevation reading which is due to the weather. Additionally, there is nothing which could keep you from calibrating your device more than once during a trip. In my case, I almost always pass multiple alpine huts or landmarks where the elevation is precisely known, and if the elevation reading differs from the correct value, I re-calibrate the barometer manually. Finally, you can easily test the precision of your barometer by going a round trip under stable weather conditions, and I bet that your device still reports the correct elevation when arriving at your starting point. But if it deviates by more than 10 meters, it is probably defective (provided that the weather really was stable).\",\n",

Allow half speed for the last 6 km. Carry gear for the worst seasonable weather. Alpine weather can be capricious.

Little people don't adjust automatically. Put your hand under their clothing to check for sweat. Add a layer when stopping for more than a couple minutes, and give them a chance to remove it a few minutes after going again. First rest stop do a foot check for forming blisters. Do another check in early to mid afternoon. Stop and feed every couple of hours. This is the biggest factor in getting little people to cover ground -- they burn off energy and need refueling much more frequently than an adult. At high elevation you dehydrate faster. Be sure you have enough fluids to cope. This affects little people faster than adults. Water, juice, whatever. Dress the kids in bright colours. If you have any areas of rocks larger than a toddler, they can vanish. There is merit in a harness and leash for toddlers. This is much better than holding their hand over their head for hours. A leash allows them to stoop, and pick up a pretty rock, look at a flower etc, and also prevent them from wandering over a cliff. If you have doubts, do a practice walk of this length or a bit longer in a situation where you can quit, and grab a bus or taxi. A practice run can also teach the kids the routine -- clothing adjustment, foot checks, eat, drink.\",\n",

Since I was the author of that quote you snipped and info from BPL (where I\\'m a member) has already been presented, I\\'ll just offer my anecdotal evidence that shoes are fine for your stated parameters if you have nothing wrong with your lower extremities. To me it boils down to being fit for the activity. If your ankles are weak (as evidenced from your\\'s being sore when you wear approach shoes) then you need to build them up before going to shoes all the time. By \"weak\" I mean using some muscles more than they are used, just like doing any activity that stresses muscles in ways they aren\\'t used to will cause you to be sore the next day. I just had to contort myself in all different ways to paint my deck and my back, neck and shoulders are letting me know. I only get to take 1 big trip a year. The rest of the year I may get to do a couple local trips but they are short and easy terrain. My first trip in 2009 at age 42 I rolled one ankle 3 times pretty well. It was quite painful for a while but I still managed 100 miles over 10 days in the Smoky Mountains. I guess I should note I didn\\'t work out and sit behind a desk all day. 69\" tall and around 160 lbs. After that trip I started wearing only sandals nearly everywhere. I think on the 2010 trip (first time in Rockies) I only rolled it once but I was in much better shape that summer from gutting/remodeling my house (and down to 145 lbs!). 2011 trip I had a major knee issue (took first major downhill too quickly) and a couple small ankle tweaks. After that, I realized I needed to train more before my trips with the goals being to strengthen my knees (and by default the rest of my lower extremities) and build some cardio for the elevation. Now I walk/jog the bleachers at the high school for an hour 3 x /week a couple months before each trip. That\\'s it. Well, I also started biking a little this year. Since then I\\'ve not had any knee or ankle issues. I can almost guarantee I would have severely sprained/strained my ankle on this last trip because of the difficulty of the terrain, but the many times I felt my foot shift to the side or rotate it held up just fine. I would have fallen if I was wearing boots. Of course, the flipside is a I move much quicker and hop to smaller rocks sometimes since I am wearing shoes. That brings up the other huge benefit of shoes is they are still lighter than any similar boot and that is a proven advantage. Think I saw a question here where someone posted the Army study. No, shoes aren\\'t for everyone. Some people clearly have foot/ankle issues that may not work well with shoes. Some people are so clumsy they need ankle protection from rocks. :) However, that could be a false assumption on their part since they may not need the protection if they were in lighter shoes that allowed them to be more nimble. Some people are not willing to put in any effort to strengthen their feet/ankles over time. For the majority of folks hiking on trails (or off trail) in summer, shoes are the superior choice. I think those that try them and don\\'t like them think they\\'ll feel as good or better the first couple times and that\\'s just not the case unless you\\'ve already got solid feet and ankles from playing sports or similar. Or perhaps they went with too light a shoe with little or no rockplate. I could add more but this is long enough already. I just figured I should chime in since you had quoted me. :) Oh, and I personally use Inov-8 Roclite 315 shoes that sadly aren\\'t made anymore. :( If you find a brand/model that works well for you, buy several pair since they normally only stick around a couple years.',\n",

However, the kind of routes they're climbing are typically not the kind of high-angle stuff that you have in mind when you go out for a day of rock climbing. There are people who do things like mixed rock/ice climbing, but you really have to know what you're doing. I've never done any aid climbing, but aid climbing in the rain sounds to me like a really, really bad idea, because often the placements are extremely marginal. I think there are really two separate issues you want to keep in mind when attempting to apply your trad technique under wet conditions. One is that lubrication reduces friction, so for example a cam in a flaring crack might not hold if it's wet, even though it would have held under dry conditions. But of course not all gear placements depend on friction. If you place a big hex in a constriction, no friction is required. And even with an active placement that requires friction, the way active gear works is based on the principle that as you increase the tension on the rope, the gear presses against the rock harder and harder, giving more friction. The other issue is rock quality. Even on well known trad routes, there is sometimes rock fall. A rock can hold over and over again under whatever strain is applied to it by climbers -- which could mean placing gear behind it, or simply using it as a hold -- but one day, it comes loose. For example, there could be a refrigerator-sized boulder sitting on huge, sloping ledge at the top of a single-pitch climb, which everyone has been using as a belay anchor. It's been holding non-leader falls for years just fine. But on a day when it's raining hard, that amount of force might finally cause it to slide off. Erosion is a natural process that shows bursts of activity at irregular time intervals due to conditions. If you're in the mountains during or soon after a storm, you will often see new rockslides. This is why, for example, there are huge debris-control dams at the bottoms of the canyons in our mountains in Los Angeles. Entire towns have been wiped out by boulders and mud during once-in-a-century storms. In other words, there is no guarantee that something will stay stable just because it's been stable for x years in the past. You're describing temperatures hovering around freezing. One of the natural processes that leads to erosion is the situation where water, ice, or snow gets into cracks between rocks and then undergoes freeze-thaw cycles, expanding and contracting with each cycle. People quarrying rocks have sometimes used this effect intentionally to break rocks apart, e.g., by drilling holes in the rock and letting rain fill them. The Trad Climber's Bible by John Long and Peter Croft has a brief section on climbing in the rain. They basically describe it as a misfortune that befalls you because the weather forecast was wrong, and they suggest common-sense ways of dealing with the emergency: don't panic; close your chalk bag and stick it under your clothing; slow down and be deliberate about your movements; place more gear than you normally would; pull on gear if necessary; avoid moss and slime.\",\n",

As mentioned above, the straps seem like a pretty good indicator that the picture is real. Even if he was moving, skining up a slope is a pretty smooth movement that wouldn't disturb the straps much. If there was any wind then there is a low chance that the two straps would be parallel with each other. Posing for a picture like this would be pretty easy. Given grippy snow conditions, you could skin up an entire mountain at that angle. Many people I know (including myself) prefer a steep skin track because it makes the Elevation Gain/Distance Traveled ratio higher. Although I think it is technically more energy efficient to be at less of an angle. Seeing as this was posted to an article specificaly about steep skining, and the ease of taking such picture. I would say there isn't any motivation to fake it.\",\n",

I've even filled up a bag with weights to use on the stepmill. As for specific weightlifting exercises, hiking requires a lot of lower body strength and endurance. Various squats and deadlifts can help strengthen your quads, hamstrings, glutes, and back. General cardio (running, biking, or swimming) is always helpful since it'll build endurance, and if you can shave some pounds off your body, that's less weight you have to carry.

I would advise anyone planning on heading out into the hills to read both of these excellent books - Langmuir is the book for British Mountain Leader Training, and the Mountaineers covers a lot extra information for activities over in North America. I don\\'t think being away from the treeline is particular problematic (unless you are the only thing on a very flat piece of ground). As long as you are not on the top of a ridge/hill, then there is a safe \"shadow zone\" on the side of the hill - I think something of the order of 2/3 of the way between the hilltop and its base. The only thing is - you should sit on top of a plastic sheet or your backpack to prevent picking up stray eddy currents from the ground. From Langmuir (Mountaincraft and Leadership, 3rd Edition): You can get a shadow from a 7m or taller cliff where the safe zone is between 3m from the base out to the height of the cliff - this means standing 5m from a 7m cliff should reduce your chance of a lightning strike (note - reduce - there is still a chance you can get hit, there is no 0%). There is a diagram on page 227 of 3rd Edition - I can\\'t find one to link to, unfortunately. He doesn\\'t say how steep the cliff should be, though. If you enter a cave for shelter (or dive under a boulder) - you must have at least 3m head room (so - 5m total) and 1m to either side. From The Mountaineers (Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills, 6th Edition): These guys are pretty clear: If thunderstorms are forecast: Do not camp or climb in a narrow valley or gully Do not plan to climb or hike in high, exposed areas Watch small cumulus clouds for strong, upward growth Keep track of weather reports If you spot a thunderstorm: Get away from water Seek low ground in an open valley or meadow Move immediately if your hair stands on end Do not stand under trees, especially in open areas Do not remain near metal or graphite equipment Insulate yourself from the ground with your pack or a foam mat Crouch to minimise your profile Do not lie down Gauge the movement of the thunderstorm',\n",

(I am strictly sticking to the point that it\\'s not caused solely by descending the mountain). The intensity can vary person to person and that is depending upon habits one has developed over time. Habits here refer to the speed of walking on a descent, Calcium-rich diet, packing sense, load-carrying abilities, etc. If you go to a physician, He/She will term this pain as Chondromalacia or Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome . These are the most common types of pain around or behind the kneecaps, which is often diagnosed among not only trekkers, but in runners, skiers, and cyclists. I hope this makes one understand that it\\'s not only because of the Descent . In layman\\'s terms I\\'d say it\\'s there when you exert your knee, be it in a way with your driving as well sometimes. The weight/load that you carry, adds more strain to the knees. Period! A downhill walk with a heavy backpack is definitely a strenuous task for the knees. It\\'s because anecdotal studies say that while descending with each step that you take, the amount of force exerted on you knees is roughly thrice the normal body weight. The moment you find your knees hurting on a descend, try and keep a steady and a calm pace, need not to rush downhill, if you are carrying excess weight, make sure that the load is distributed in a well manner and see if your fellows can help you with the heavy backpack. Drink adequate water. If you experience pain on the trail after a hard day of walking, bring along some Ibuprofen/Painkiller or maybe some gel/ointment to reduce the pain and inflammation (if there is any) and stretch your quadriceps before you start again. You may also find that wearing a knee brace/cap is helpful. Never hike knee-locked down a steep decline! Walk at a steady, slow pace and keep the knees flexed. The faster you hike, the longer your stride tends to be, which intensifies the weight and impact to your knee. Do not jump or take long strides: It kills the knee! If time permits, pick a trail that goes in a zig-zag manner, sideways or s-shaped rather than going straight down hills whenever possible by making your own mini-switchbacks on wide trails. If possible, plan hikes where the downhill is at the end of the journey rather than the beginning. This way you have consumed most of your food weight, cooking fuel, etc. Dump unneeded water before heading downhill. Wear the shoes that are of your shoe size and have good cushion for comfort. In the long term, make sure your body is prepared for a hike with lots of downhill by doing exercises to strengthen the muscles around the knee, and hike or walk downhill regularly.',\n",

The leader places protection points whilst climbing and the second climber removes them again. There might be the odd piece of permanent gear - pitons or bolts - but the climbing team is basically responsible for arranging their own protection. In sport climbing, bolts are pre-placed by somebody , usually a local enthusiast or group of enthusiasts. How stuff is funded/maintained varies a lot from area to area, but it is almost always voluntary efforts of some kind. Formal standards don\\'t exist, although most areas have best practices that are generally understood and adhered to by people putting in or maintaining fixed equipment. Exactly what these best practices are vary a lot from area to area depending on type of rock, proximity to salt water etc. IANAL, but from what I\\'ve read there might be some question of legal liability if people putting in fixed gear blatantly violate local best practices. Bolt spacing norms in particular vary a lot from area to area. One of my local areas is the Frankenjura. There the locals generally bolt the routes so you won\\'t hit the ground, but they don\\'t care how scared you are. So you might be looking at doing hard climbing much further above a - solid - bolt than you are used to or comfortable with.

Exception: Steep descents on irregular footing -- slopes of large scree are an example -- can be slower going down than going up. Indeed there is a 'magic slope' a couple percent grade, going down, that seems to be just enough to overcome friction, and you cruise seemingly without effort.

Those were only so-so, but they get better from there. There are a couple disadvantages. Not as much surface area as a larger ski (or some snowshoes) Harder to get up very steep hills (as compared to teles with skins, or snowshoes, though there are some skins designed for them - they are rare) Not as durable as teles or snowshoes Really a lot of this depends on the terrain and your desires.',\n",

First, it sounds as though you do not have experience hiking at altitudes above 10,000 feet. If this is so, my advice is to take a few day hikes (carrying significant weight on your back) before embarking on a multi-day trip, especially if you have to meet distance goals on the trip, for example to get to good camping spots. Your body will tell you if you are going too fast: listen to it. Your heart rate will increase and you will be out of breath to the point that you will be uncomfortable. These are the same messages your body sends you at sea level when you are running or working hard, but they will come much sooner at altitude. I recommend that you experiment with pace, with the goal not speed or distance but endurance; that is, how long you can go before your body insists that you stop. If you feel that it sure would be nice to stop, but that you don't have to stop, you've hit the right pace. At the end of the day, you should feel tired, but not wiped out. I'm not going to discuss acclimatization or precautions against, or how to recognize, altitude sickness: that goes beyond the scope of this question.\",\n",

Ice and snowboards don\\'t make for a great day out, so avoiding it is important, however any back country boarder or skier needs the skills to handle this kind of unexpected variation. No matter how experienced you are, you can always be caught out and suddenly find yourself on a sheet of ice. Often all you can really do is ride it out till you get back onto snow - depends how skilled you are and how hard the ice is as to what you can do. Don\\'t enter terrain traps such as you described unless you are sure you can safely board/ski them. Presume they are icy till proven otherwise. Ice, especially if sunny, will have a polished look or a shine to it. Normally there is a transition line where the powder disappears and the ice becomes exposed. The powder can be a very thin layer on top of the ice, in which case you cannot see the difference, and need to read the terrain. If you don\\'t have enough depth of powder to maintain control, but can\\'t see that, life can become very interesting very quickly. Look for a transition that changes texture and colour, sometime though its very subtle. Often ice tends to have a blueish hue. Check the depth of the powder at various locations based on the terrain, get a feel for how deep the top powder layer is. If its shallow in one place, it will be shallow (or none) in others. Look for terrain where the wind is funneled - this is where snow will have been blown away. Pick a rounte that puts you on the lee slopes. The transition from ice to powder can also be challenging, but its usually in an embarrassing face plant into soft snow kind of way rather than a dangerous disappear down the mountain at high speed way. Only other thing to be very aware of, an ice layer with snow on top is a prime condition for avalanche - if you are dealing with a lot of fresh wind blown powder and coming across ice be very careful of the lee slopes.',\n",

Choose one of those fancy ones where guys hang around listening to punk/rap-music :) The common ski- or sport-shops are in general not that reliable when it comes to snowboarding. The other considerations are summed up in this article from the Austrian board-shop \"Blue Tomato\" : Most important: the size The most important criterion when buying a new boot is the right size. The Mondo point size, the length of your foot, is a good guideline. When your legs are straight, you may touch the front of your boot lightly. However, when you bend your knees this should not happen. Pay attention that your heel is snug in the boot and cannot move. Boots of different brands do not have the same length and width, so keep in mind that the boot should also fit your binding. Some brands use half-size liners in their outer shoes. If you have large feet but do not want to ride a wide board, you can save important millimetres in toe- and heel area with this information. The flex value Snowboard boots are available as hard- and soft boots. For freestyle as well as freeride, you use soft boots. They are available in different flex rates: softer boots for freestyle and harder boots for freeride. Hard boots are solely for racing and carving. They greatly restrict the freedom of movement, so that you can bring pressure to the edge, even at high speed. As you\\'ve described that you want to ride on the slope and a little backcountry, I would choose a flex value of 7. Lacing The lacing of your snowboard boots is essential for the hold. As a rule, you can distiguish three different lacing systems: traditional lacing, quick lacing systems and Boa. So the question is: what is the perfect system for you? We will explain this! The classic among lacing systems is still the first choice for many riders. No other system can adjust the pressure as well as with the old-school variant. The laces have a solid core that prevents the knot from loosening. The soft coat gives the necessary grip to your fingers to get a bombproof hold. Okay, if you ride really hard, you’ll probably have to readjust them during the day. The quick lacing systems, speed lacing, have become a fixed part of the sport. Nowadays there is an almost bewildering array, from “twin lacing” to “speed zone”. The principle is the same for all of them, but, depending on the price range, you get a system for the whole shoe, two divided speed-lacing systems for the top and bottom of the boot or even a three-part system with extra lacing for more heel-hold. With these systems, you thread the laces through plastic- or metal devices, tighten them to the desired level and secure them in the device. This only takes a few seconds. The more zones the system has, the more accurately you can adjust the boot to your foot and preferences. Superficially, BOA is a quick lacing system. The only difference is that it uses wire and wheels. Depending on the price range the BOA system also offers, one, two or even three adjuster wheels for the different areas of the boot and often even for the liner. Turning the wheel tightens the bootlaces evenly; pushing the button loosens the wire again. You can also use this system easily while wearing gloves. When it comes to hold, BOA is the first choice. It is not the fastest system to tighten, but it is number one to loosen: one button-push and the wire is loosened! A few words on the Liner The liner is included with your snowboard boots. It increases the comfort of the fairly hard outer boot. Several models even have a thermo liner, which you can heat-mould to match the shape of your foot. If you are prone to pressure points or particular parts of your feet give you problems, a thermo liner may be the solution. You can get your thermo liners customised in many Blue Tomato shops; with some liners, you can even do it yourself in the oven at home. There are liners, especially for the park, with integrated cushioning that dampens hard landings. Sole Cushioning Boots have cushioning so you can survive hard landings without bruising your heels. Essentially, there are four types of cushioning: EVA , an especially light and flexible plastic that is often used for cushioning. However, it loses its shape with excessive cold, and therefore diminishes in quality. PU is a strong and durable plastic that does not lose its properties, even in icy temperatures, but costs more than EVA. Air cushioning in the sole absorbs high impacts. This works especially well on the heel and forefoot areas, but less with icy temperatures. Gel pads are usually incorporated around the heel and work in the same way as air cushions, but are less susceptible to different temperatures. Don\\'t forget the socks Even the perfect soft boot cannot realise its potential when you do not wear the right socks. Functional socks, which are long with reinforcements at critical points, maximise the fit of your shoe. Normal socks are too thin, can chafe at critical points and, in the worst case, slide down, wrinkle and provide unnecessary pressure points that can become really painful. An adjustment of the liner by the use of special fans and sometimes even ovens is possible and advisable for most models in the middle and upper price segment. You can find information about this in the product descriptions or on the boot itself. In case of doubt, our customer service will help you.',\n",

That answer attributes the picture to a site called Straightchuter , which gives the name of the person who made this climb and the technique, called Steep Skinning, needed to do it. If indeed that is the same picture, then the picture you have would not have been altered. It's a photo of Chris Figenshau skinning up a 34-degree icy slope in New Zealand with textbook perfect style. These are the instructions he offers in order to make this climb. Keep your back straight – don’t bend/break at the waist Keep your skis as flat as possible on the snow to maximize the surface area Keep your skis as flat as possible on the snow to maximize the surface area Press through your heels (important) Plant your poles near to your toepieces – not too far forward or off to the side. Stay off of your edges. If you need to move sideways, “crab” to the left or right by moving your entire ski instead of trying to edge. Look up and forward, not down at your boots. As the Bloodhound Gang song goes – “Lift your head up high and blow your brains out.” Steep skinning may be painful until you get the hang of it, but it also gets you places in a hurry. He concludes by saying: If you find yourself slipping, try lifting your big toe. This is hard to do if you are leaning forward, (so lean back) and it will help shift your weight to the aft. It’s like hitting the brakes.\",\n",

The least steep terrain is where the contour lines are as far apart as possible. If the distance between the contour lines is zero, it's a vertical cliff. I would not try to find a route using perspective renderings such as google earth's. It's very, very difficult to judge the steepness of a slope from a perspective view. Other factors to keep in mind would be rock quality, snow, and glaciers. Glaciers and permanent snow fields are indicated on topo maps. If snow cover is seasonal, then you can usually anticipate that the snow will come down lower in elevation during the winter, and it will persist for longer on north-facing slopes. If the rock quality is poor, then climbing on snow can actually be easier and safer.\",\n",

Most of the board is then covered by the body so there is minimal added wind resistance compared with horizontal mounting, were most of the board sticks out on the side and act as a huge sail. With horizontal mounting you have a much higher moment of inertia. So turning is awkward and you will much easier catch branches and the like (even though that can happen with vertical mounting too above the head, but much less). Firm attachment is also better, as you can fixate it farther apart, as backpacks are usually longer in height than they are in width. So ideally you have a backpack designed to do tours with a snowboard. They have dedicated attachment straps on the back and are opened by zips along the backpack brim or even on back. This allows you to reach your stuff even with mounted board, which is very awkward with they usual closing with a top pocket and a strap on the outside towards the bottom. If you do not have such a dedicated backpack you need some kind of attachment points on the top and bottom of the pack. Many backpacks have straps on the side on the top and the bottom to mount skis or to compress them. You can use two additional straps (not part of the backpack itself) that you feed through those straps on the side so that they run twice from side to side over the backpack. Then you insert your board such that the lower binding is just above the lower strap, which keeps it from sliding down. Then you also attach the upper strap and tighten both. If your backpack is not filled up quite will, you will also have to tighten the straps on the side to make it stable. This is my usual setup as skier when I carry a board of a participant and it gives a very secure fix, but the problem with opening the backpack remains. So this is fine for occasional use, but if you like doing snowboard tours it is well worth to invest in a dedicated backpack.',\n",

If there was any wind then there is a low chance that the two straps would be parallel with each other. Posing for a picture like this would be pretty easy.

Because of that friction, you will not experience much that resembles cross country skiing, except for maybe some skating type action. Without skins the skis will give you no grip, you'll have to use poles & skating to go anywhere. Ideally your route will not have any long flat sections. A skill you might work on is going uphill with all that weight on your feet. You won't need to lift your foot for every step, as long as the skis tips stay on top of the snow, so that's just a matter of exercise. You will probably have to change direction on steep slopes, meaning lift one ski out, turn it ~180° then transfer your weight onto it, while your poles are sinking into that bottomless powder. This can get quite awkward and a little frustrating, so I'd practice that before committing to a long day in the back country.

Depending on where you are you might get deep powder, very chunky sun cups, avalanche debris that's like rubble, or inch-thick ice. You can practice skiing those while in-bounds, if your local ski resort isn't too obsessive about grooming. As ab2 said, get some avalanche training, and find out about your local avalanche forecast.

If the terrain permits it, keep that way till you stop; it's the safest. If the terrain becomes rocky, try to brake without your feet until there is no other option any more. Meaning the risk to get into an uncontrolled tumble is negligible, as falling over a ridge/crashing into rocks/... is imminent and worse. Ice-axe Hold one hand on the shaft, the other on the head of the ice-axe and position it in front of your chest. Apply pressure by leaning onto it. Again do this gradually, sticking it into hard packed snow will probably yank it out of your hands. This position might be scary as the ice-axe is pretty close to your face. True, this is dangerous, but this is a life-threatening situation, so braking efficiency wins over the potentially broken nose or missing tooth. Neither Get up onto your underarms, then lift all your body so that only the underarms and feet are in contact with the snow. In certain conditions you might even want to get into a push-up position (only hands and feet on the ground).\",\n",

Simply attaching the board to the back of the backpack does not look like the best option. I heard from people that this causes the board to swing around and to be a pain for the shoulders. Some people seem to have the boards horizontal, which allows them to have them closer to their back (good), but if walking through a forest or narrow passage this can be a problem. I don't know if that would be possible with my standard hiking backpack. What's the best way to attach a snowboard during a skitour?

However, if the snow is sufficiently deep and soft that you\\'re sinking up to your knees, why is it the case that slipping and being unable to self-arrest is so dangerous? In these conditions, typically you can\\'t even intentionally get going fast enough to glissade or practice self-arrest. Given the conditions you\\'re describing, the first thing I would worry about is avalanche danger. If the snow is that deep and soft, it sounds like you\\'ve just had a storm dumping a ton of fresh powder. Typically there is significant avalanche danger if there\\'s (a) a lot of fresh snow, and (b) a slope of about 30-35 degrees or more. Since you\\'re describing a slope of \"nearly 30 degrees,\" I think my basic answer is that you should not be out in those conditions due to avalanche danger. I would not suggest going out and then making the decision about whether conditions are OK to go up. There has been a lot of work by social scientists studying why people die in avalanches. Avalanche safety courses and transponders are not really highly correlated with survival. Once people get there, there are strong social forces pushing them forward. See Ian McCammon, \"Evidence of heuristic traps in recreational avalanche accidents,\" http://www.snowpit.com/articles/traps%20reprint.pdf Obvious Assumptions: I have walking sticks, equipment, Ice axe. If the slopes are a little less steep than you\\'re describing, or there\\'s not as much fresh snow, then the avalanche danger might be acceptable, and then these are conditions where you want snowshoes. Personally, I don\\'t bring poles when I\\'m going to be on snowshoes; I just bring an ice ax, which I only use if I\\'m on a steep slope. For mountaineering, you want snowshoes that have crampons. As far as routefinding, you have various options, the most straightforward of which is not to march up to 22,000\\' in the middle of a storm. If you find yourself in whiteout conditions, you could try to use GPS, but since GPS isn\\'t 100% reliable, I wouldn\\'t intentionally seek out conditions where you were likely to need it in order to get down from such high altitude.',\n",

The steeper the better Slow and steady wins the race Since you used \"effective\" rather than possible, my 2 cents would be that you should set the steepest skin track that allows you to climb at a consistent rate. If the track is so steep that you are stopping to rest every 10 steps, you will gain elevation slowly. There is also a school of thought that says your uptrack should be as beautiful as your tracks descending. This school tends to smooth transitions and lower climb angles. They view zig-zag kick turns as the method of last resort. A great source for tips from the Steeper is Better school is the website SteepChuter.com website The exact angle that will be \\'too steep\\' on any given day is far too dependent on conditions and equipment to pick any numeric values. Generally it\\'s somewhere between 20 and 30 degrees. A good rule of thumb is that if it\\'s too steep to skin straight up, you should start thinking about avalanche hazard. As to when booting up is a more efficient means, this depends a lot snow conditions and how heavy your skis are. If the snow is hard and icy, crampons can be faster on even relatively flat slopes. I often use just crampons for early morning starts in spring corn snow ski season. Booting up is generally only used in soft snow conditions when the terrain doesn\\'t allow a zig-zag skin track.

What does the Mountain, Valley and the height mentioned mean? The highest and the lowest points in the resort. The height is the height meters above the see level of both of those points. What does the \"Fresh snow\" (in centimes?) mean? How much fresh snow will be falling on that particular day. Note that there are 4 bars for each day, the heights of the bars show in which part of the day (night, morning, afternoon or evening) it will be snowing the most. The number (e.g. 12cm), says the total amount of fresh snow for the day when measured on the ground after it has fallen. What amount of fresh snow is ideal and is it better if it has snowed the day before but not on the day of snowboarding? If you are a beginner, you probably prefer the days with no or little fresh snow. If you are an advanced skier who skis in the back country, you will be chasing the days with as much fresh snow as possible. What does the rainfall(in liters?) mean? What would be a bad amount of rainfall that would make the visit meaningless? The amount of rain that will fall on that particular day. Normally you do not want any rain while skiing, as it makes the slopes icy, your clothes wet, and the whole experience uterly unenjoyable. It might be ok if it is in the valey only, but then it will mean snow on top of the mountain. In any case, snow is much more preferable than rain. What does snow line mean? The height at which snow starts. Note that the slopes below it might still be covered with snow. Also, general advice on picking a good day to go and learn would be appreciated! There are a few additional things you should keep in mind when selecting a good day for skiing: Temperature Sun hours Wind speed Snow condition The best temperature depends on personal preferences, but you should avoid the extremes. If it is too cold (-15 or -20), you might be freezing. If it is too warm (around +10, or even a bit less), the snow might be melting, becoming heavy and less slipery. For it to be too hot though, it must be fairly late in the season. As a beginner you want as much sun as possible. More sun means better visibility and a more enjoyable experience altogether while rolling around on your ass. You do not want the wind to be too strong. e.g. the days where it is marked red in your example forecast. Strong winds might mean closed lifts, snow being blown in your face, you being cold, harder to control your snowboard/skis, etc. You want the snow condition to be fresh (Neuschnee), with grip (griffig), or maybe slushy (not sure how it is in German). Basically anything else than icy (eisig). Especially so when you are on a snowboard. The snow condition and some extra info you can get by clicking on a specific day in the forecast. Just as an example, in this specific weather forecast, the best days would be Tuesday and Wednesday. But keep in mind that weather in the mountains is especially hard to predict. I would say that the forecasts are reliable max 1 or 2 days in advance. And even then I would not count too much on it. The general trend (getting warmer and less snowy) might be correct, but do not expect it to be on Tuesday exactly.',\n",

As @imsodin points out in the comments, a ski resort is (compared to a lot of outdoor settings) a pretty safe place to make a mistake about clothing: if you find yourself too cold or wet, you can get indoors quickly; if you stay on-piste, your chances of death or serious injury from exposure are practically nil. Another advantage is that you're only skiing for, usually, a few hours per day; if your clothes get soaked, they have >12 hours to dry out overnight before you go back out. Ski-field conditions can vary hugely in terms of sun, wind, air temperature, and precipitation -- even during the course of a day. Whatever you wear needs to be able to deal, to some extent, with any conditions you're likely to encounter. If there's a chance you'll hit freeze-thaw conditions, you'll want a jacket, and preferably trousers, that's reasonably waterproof. You're unlikely to find yourself skiing in pouring rain, so serious full-on waterproofing isn't essential, but your jacket should at least be able to handle a bit of sleet and wet snow without soaking through. I skied for years without any specialist clothing, though admittedly only for a week or so per season. Initially I was using a cheap, sort-of-slightly-water-resistant jacket and overtrousers, sized fairly large, with as many layers of synthetic thermals and fleeces as required to keep me warm on the day. For my first time skiing or snowboarding, I definitely wouldn't invest in a specialized jacket. Even if you end up buying one later, you'll be able to make a better selection once you have some experience on the slopes. There's no question that a specialized skiing/snowboarding jacket makes life more pleasant, but it's by no means necessary. As a slight aside, there are three things you will want to think about: gloves, goggles, and a helmet. Ski gloves are thicker than most everyday gloves, and layering is seldom effective: you can get away with a light glove liner and generously sized outer glove, but in general you risk reducing your circulation and making your hands colder if you try to stack up too many gloves (source: bitter experience). Goggles are also hard to substitute with everyday equivalents: in good conditions you can get by with a decent pair of wrap-around sunglasses, but even cheap goggles do a lot better as soon as you have wind, snow, or sweat to contend with. As for the helmet, you can probably hire one, but check the prices: often it doesn't take many days of rental charges to equal the purchase price.\",\n",

With virgin snow, it's generally best to go with one or more buddies who can trade off in trail breaking, or go for very short trips. Hardest: Very hilly or mountainous, especially with virgin snow. If you're sticking to flat terrain or groomed trails, you can pretty much get out and go with little or no instruction (depending on your tolerance for falling and being awkward). I don't know about Quebec specifically, but in Massachusetts, some golf courses rent cross country skis in the winter, and groom tracks for skiers to use. Other courses don't make it official, but still allow skiers on their grounds. Depending on what you are looking for, a season's pass to a local golf course may satisfy your need for exercise at a reasonable cost. The disadvantage would be that you could only ski at that location. If you want harder terrain, it would be worth either taking a lesson, or going out with a friend who skis.

The biggest impacts to back-country areas from non-motorized recreation come from vegetation disturbance: boots grinding up plants and breaking topsoil, tents compressing vegetation, camp activity destroying vegetation, fire scars, etc. A few inches of snow will largely protect the fragile flora beneath provided there is enough snow that you are not punching through to the soil/vegetation below. Thus, xc-skiing, snowshoeing, snowboarding, and downhill skiing will leave absolutely no trace of your passing -- again, provided there is enough snow. You do mention the tops of saplings sticking up. Avoid them. If when you pass on your board you see broken saplings in your wake, the snow is not deep enough. Use common sense. As for local fauna - they\\'re all pretty used to hiding in holes anyway, and your passing by on skis likely won\\'t disturb them. (A major exception is elk and deer calving grounds, which are often identified on US public lands maps, and are usually closed to snowmobiles and sometimes skiers.) The impacts you DO need to be concerned about are waste, trash, and etc. that easily get buried beneath snow where they seemingly \"disappear.\" Pack it in, pack it out. Of course, the biggest impact from non-motorized winter recreation is the motorized facilities of ski resorts which consume vast amounts of electricity to haul people up on lifts, diesel fuel to run snow cats that make those perfectly groomed trails, and development impacts that can encroach into wild lands.',\n",

I would suggest that a protector (stand alone, not built into a pack) is going to offer much better protection than any back pack can offer. Main difference The main difference appears to be how the back protector is held against your back. There is a big difference to a protector made so that is held tightly to your back via several wide straps and a back pack with a thin waist band and a couple of shoulder straps. (similar to the one in the pack you mention). the back pack is going to move if you fall, the body armour isn't, thus it will provide better protection. Now on top of this you don't mention what kind of terrain your boarding on? Is it off or on-piste, etc. The more difficult and dangerous the terrain the better the back protection your going to want. If it's simple on-piste green run, I'm sure a back pack (with some protection in it) will be fine. If your planning on heli-snowboarding, I'd invest in a good level back protector/body armour. Is it disturbing or even unsafe to combine the two? Might things start to slide out of position? No, I don't see why it would be?

In my opinion the relevant question is wether it will be hot or cold !

Just keep your gear tight, with straps pointing out (eg, gaiter strap on left foot is pointing left, straps on right snowshoe are pointing right) so they don't get caught and trip you, and keep your gait a bit wider than normal hiking. Poles with snow baskets are a good idea almost all the time, even when not in snowshoes. Poles help take stress off your lower joints, so they are good for all around hiking as well. I recommend the adjustable ones with interchangeable baskets so you can use them for multiple things and they don't get in the way when strapped on your pack. If the slope is steep and icy, you're better off putting on crampons and having your ice axe ready for arrest. Don't forget in addition to the ten essentials, for winter mountaineering you will almost always want the trifecta of snowshoes, ice axe and crampons. If there's possibility of avalanche, beacon, probe and shovel are also essential. Out of all of these, snowshoes take the least training. Just hike with a wide gait.\",\n",

       "    'body': 'To expand a bit on the good answer already given: Slope - 25-45 degrees is a good broad suggestion, but your region of the country will have a big impact on this. Maritime snow is wetter and stickier, so tends to be most dangerous at steeper angles. Transitional and Continental snow is less wet, so has a most dangerous slope range on the lower end of the scale. Find out more specific information from the avalanche center closest to your location. Any rapid changes to snow position, temperature, or sun. Lots of fresh snow, lots of wind moving snow around, a rapid change in temperature can all increase avalanche danger. The avalanche dragon hates change, and it makes him angry. Stable conditions are less likely to enrage him. \"Whumfing\", cracking or visible settling. All very serious danger signs. Avalanche chutes - look for places where avalanches have happened in the past, by looking for debris, or places where there are no big trees all of a sudden. But also look for evidence of recent avalanches. Check high slopes above you all the time - if you see a few fresh looking slides, that is a huge danger sign. Forgetting the snow for a moment, remember that an avalanche fatality requires two things - snow conditions, and a person to be there. Avalanche deaths are primarily men, aged 20-29, who are experienced skiers. Not because avalanches like these people more, but because they are most likely to find themselves in a risky location, doing a risky thing. Group dynamics and decision making will have a greater impact on your survival than snow science (though that is important, too). In nearly all avalanche fatalities, the investigation finds that someone in the group either identified the hazard, or had sufficient training to identify the hazard, and yet the group did the dangerous thing anyway. Evaluate your group and make some rules: Everyone has veto power on dangerous situations. Make several plans. Instead of \"we are gonna ski that wicked bowl\", decide on a few options in different locations so if one area looks dangerous you are comfortable changing plans. Don\\'t get lulled into a false sense of security by good weather, or having an \"expert\" in the group. Everyone\\'s eyes are open, and everyone discusses the situation as they see it. Don\\'t get macho - if the conditions don\\'t feel right, its fine to turn back. When they say \"go big or go home\", remember that sometimes it\\'s just fine to go home. ;) And finally - take a class. Depending on where you are, there are probably some good Level 1 or introductory courses available free or inexpensively. Bring your friends, too - being trained on avalanche safety doesn\\'t make YOU safer, it makes your friends safer. Bring them along and you\\'ll all be more likely to ski another day.',\n",

You can fall in 5 positions face down head up (hill) face down head down face up head up face up head down tumble On descent you are more likely to fall head down. Face up head up is best as you can get the axe in position. Roll toward the pick ( very important ). Face down head up if you are not in position then role to your back to the side of the pick, get axe in position, and role back. Face down head down then above your head to the side dig in the pick and swing into position. This takes some strength and practice. Will need the axe in position before you hit the ground.

I now need to roll onto my front to push the head of the axe into the snow. But how do I do that without catching my crampons (as I roll). Does that make sense? When you're on your back, you don't need to get your crampons in the air. The front points are what would snag, and they're pointing at the sky. Even if you wanted to keep the heels of your crampons off the snow (which isn't necessary), you really couldn't, because your knees don't bend that way, and it's not practical to raise your legs at the hips in this situation. To roll, throw your weight to the side, as if you were rolling out of bed. The direction to roll is the one that heads the pick toward the snow like an arrow. Once you start rolling over, you can bend your knees to keep the front points of your crampons off the snow. All of this is theoretical and idealized. It's how you should practice it in order to get it in your muscle memory. But in reality it may not actually work out this way, and in a real self-arrest you may actually need to use your front points -- if that's what it takes to keep from going over a cliff, that's what you do.\",\n",

It\\'s like trying to tell someone how to tie their shoes. The following applies to any physical skill. \"Show me\" is far better than \"Tell me\" Search for downhill skiing tutorial on youtube. Watching a new physical activity really helps. Not just one. Watch a dozen different ones. Some you may want to rewatch. Youtube has an option to play at half or quarter speed. Mirroring it as much as you can helps too. Close your eyes and try to \\'feel\\' what it will feel like helps. (Pre-visualization) Skiing specific tips: Biggest mistake most people make is leaning back. Imagine a banana in your skiboot between your shin and the front of the boot. Keep your weight forward so that you are squishing the banana. This feels very risky, and seems counterintuitive. Try this right now: Stand up. Bend your knees a bit. Close your eyes. Now can you feel weight on both your heel and toe? Put more weight on your toes. Play with that, moving your weight from toe to heel. Push it to the point where your heel lifts up just a bit. Go back to where your toes lift up a bit. Keep your eyes closed, otherwise you are judging your lean with your eyes. That shift of weight between heel and toe is a big part of controlling the sky. Too many people put weight on their heels. Needs to be more on the toes. The ski matters In general a shorter ski is easier to work with. If you are having trouble try a ski 20 cm shorter. A shorter ski however is slower. In general a softer ski (easier to bend) is easier to work with. Turns happen in part to weight shifting, in part to changing the bend in the ski. At low speeds it\\'s only your weight forcing the bend. More weight on left ski, ski bends more. Edge is now a section of a circle. At higher speeds you have G forces (acceleration, centripetal...) to do this too. So as you become more of a speed freak, you want a harder ski. (On the other hand if you like moguls, and tiny tree trails, you may want to stay with a soft ski -- easier to turn.)

       "    'body': 'Skiing is a full-body, high endurance, activity. Being in good cardio-vascular shape is important, and can be achieved through running, swimming, rowing, etc... This can not be over-emphasized. Get your heart in shape. Assuming you already are in decent shape, here are some exercises that will help you get through those initial days on the hill. I\\'ve chosen exercises that require no additional weight -- your body and gravity provide all the resistance you need. (Some can be enhanced by holding light weights if so desired.) --Leg Strengthening-- Wall squats: Sit with your back against a wall, your feet together on the ground, and your knees bent at a 90 degree angle. Hold for increasing amounts of time. As strength increases, raise one leg at a time horizontal out in front of you. Repeating multiple reps of 30 seconds to a minute. Feel the burn. Lunges: Take a large step, dropping your back knee to the ground while bending your front knee (try to keep the front knee at a 90 degree angle). Return to standing, repeat for other leg forward. Do 50 steps or more. One legged speed squats: Stand with 90% weight on one leg, and 10% on the other. Squat down and stand up as rapidly as you feel comfortable for 20-40 reps. Repeat other side. Plyometrics: If you are already in good general shape, plyometrics will amp up your legs into bomber ski shape**. Simple moves like: jump-squats: lower into a squatting position, feet shoulder width apart, then explode up through standing and jump. Return to squat position. standing three-direction jumps: stand upright, feet together. Jump up, twisting your lower body so your feet now point to the right, but shoulders point forward. Jump back to center, then left. Right -Center -Left -Center -Right. Imagine the snow-flocked pine trees whipping by your face. High knee jumps (Jump knee-tucks): Stand upright. Keeping your torso at the same height, jump your knees up toward your chest repeatedly. (Legs come up, body stays the same). --Core strength-- Your core is also super-important. Skiing (done right) requires a lot of twisting (shoulders stay pointing downhill while your lower body carves back and forth.) Crunches, sit-ups, side presses , etc are all super-helpful and common exercises, so I won\\'t explain them. A new one I\\'ve added to my repetoire (thanks P90X!) is \"Mason Twists\" aka Russian Twists: Sit with your back straight and your legs elevated in front of you so your body makes a V feet at chest level. Clasp your hands. Rotate your torso, and hit the ground on the left side with both hands. Rotate your torso to hit the ground on the right side with both hands. Go back and forth, side-to-side for 40-50 reps in rapid succession. --Balance and static strength-- Skiing is a balance sport. Knowing how your body moves, how it is centered, and how your body responds is important. Consider various yoga moves: Warrior 1,2 and 3: I won\\'t try to describe them here, since they are easy to do wrong. I recommend seeking a yoga class in your area. But the warriors are GREAT for strengthening your knees (common ski injury areas) and learning balance. Tree Pose: The ultimate balance posture. In its simplest form, stand with good posture on one leg for as long as you can. A regular yoga practice will help in all areas of fitness. * *NOTE: Higher-impact exercises like plyometrics can cause injury if done improperly. Land softly when you jump. Do not attempt unless you are in good physical condition. If in doubt, consult a health-care professional.',\n",

To briefly look at your metrics: Front tip width: Float of the front of the ski Middle width: Float of the middle of the ski Back tip width: Float of the back of the ski Radius: Float vs. pierce (if you plunge your ski through the snow, how easy is it to extract?) Height: Speed vs. turning (longer skis will increase speed and increase turning radius) Weight: Float & comfort on your legs & transport (light skis will increase your skiing endurance. Material will dictate how long they last) Camber / Rocker: Turning & speed (This helps with turning and drag. There are some fun models for demonstrating the effects of camber on a ski) Metal tip: Durability. Nucleus material: Flexibility & Strength & Weight. Stiffness: Control.\",\n",

Even when pulling a sled, skis will be faster as long as the user has enough grip to propel forward. Deep but light snow on relatively flat and open ground: This is open for debate, as not everyone agrees on which type of ski does better, but for long-distance travel in deeper snow, skis are more performant overall. Wider skis float, and given their length, they almost float as well as snowshoes, but it's not usually required to lift the legs as much as with snowshoes. With thinner skis that sink much deeper, it's possible to simply drag one's feet and 'submarine' the skis. This is much less tiring on the quads. Downhill: Self-explanatory, but it needs to be said that thinner skis don't do as well on steep descents. They are fast, but they don't give as good control as wider ones do. Snowshoes are better for: Forest travel: If there is significant chance of having to cross dense forest (tree spacing is smaller than ski length), then it's extremely slow and cumbersome to do on skis. Extremely rugged terrain: If following natural features likes frozen streams and valley bottoms, natural barriers like small cliffs, cascades, waterfalls and other sharp terrain features make skiing hell. Snowshoes are much better at dealing with them. Getting around obstacles: I made it a separate section because sometimes one is following perfect skiing terrain and then appears a patch of blowdown (fallen trees), bent over saplings (either conifers covered in snow or deciduous covered in sleet ice), or boulders. If there is enough of it, the skis' advantages can be nullified trying to get through these isolated hurdles. My general rule that I apply on long day-trips (20+km): If the terrain is open and mostly smooth (regardless of slope), I'll choose skis. If the terrain is rugged or I know I will cross enough forest patches, I'll choose snowshoes. If I face a very long open approach with a relatively short forested uphill at the end as the goal, I'll bring both. The critical step is planning. For multi-day trips, it's possible to choose a particular route so avoiding forest is more viable. For day-trips, I often take shortcuts through the woods to reduce distance but it limits which tool to bring.\",\n",

It's leaps and bounds better than skinning the whole way on the flat. And the wax doesn't stick to the glue on the skins.

So, practical experience: The simplest option to reduce slipping will be to just glue some hard waterproof low-grit (approx 60-120 grit) sanding paper on the bottom of your shoes. This is often used here amongst aging people that are less agile due to their age. If they use this trick from year to year - I assume it works:) The penguin-way to walk (particularly, small careful steps) will help you too. When you are just starting to fall, quickly squat. It helps to retain balance and even if you fall, the damage will be significantly less. Train this movement beforehand and put it to reflexes; it's hard to remember and do this trick when you're already falling. Prefer to walk close to walls, handrails, trees, bushes - any object that you can quickly catch with your hands. Especially on stairs, always keep your hand on the handrail! Prefer to keep your steps away from car roads when ice is around; it is hard to drive in such weather and very, very hard to stop the car quickly.

In any case I will suggest tours to gain experience on your own after you learned the techniques (at least theoretically). I am based in Switzerland near Zurich and do not know the Chamonix or Venice area, so I will talk about a location close to Zurich. The key abilities to do Mont Blanc guided are rope handling, glacier and steep snow techniques. So that is what I propose: The area in Glarus around the mountain \"Toedi\" is perfectly suited for all levels of such trainings. It is located at 2.5h by train or 1.5h by car from Zurich airport ( overwiew / detailed map ). Your base would be the hut \"Claridenhuette\" (red marker below the glacier) which is accessible either walking from \"Tierfehd\" (red marker) or from \"Urnerboden\" (red marker) via the cable car to \"Fisetengrat\" and from there to the hut. From there the possibilies are endless. For the very beginning there is a flat glacier nearby, where walking on crampons with a rope on a glacier, walking on sloped snow, crevasse rescue ... can be trained. To apply these newly learned skills you can do a tour on eg \"Clariden\" which is basically a long walk on the glacier with a moderately steep (max 40deg) incline at its end. Many more tours to be made. When you have gained more experience, the tour to the \"Toedi\" is very similar to the Mount Blanc save the altitude. There are also huge crevassed areas, steep slopes and long distances. But this tour is already quite advanced. Anyway you can easily get to the hut using the maps I showed you and then you will see the possibilities yourself or can ask the personel, they will gladly point you to suited areas for training. Of course there are also various guided courses available there, but they are expensive. For additional training the region of Zermatt (4h by train from Geneva) offers great tours in moderate difficulty.',\n",

Different alpine clubs have different opinions and even different mountain guides in one organization. That being said, I think the process described by @ReverendGonzo (which I will call default process ) is very common and also the doctrine of the biggest German Alpine club (\"Deutscher Alpenverein\"). Still, I will share the opinion of a very experienced guide* I was pleased to have a course with. The question was about a steep slope with frozen snow. That isn\\'t ice. For bare ice holding a fall is even more troublesome. If you are on snow (which is most likely for a classical Alpine tour), his suggestions were: don\\'t climb with an ice axe unless you really need it (use hiking or ski poles instead) falling with an ice axe in hand might cause serious injuries e.g. hitting your own face (relating to 1.) if the axe really bites the gound (which should be your primary goal) it\\'s likely that you can\\'t hold the axe, especially if you have no sling on the axe or you simply aren\\'t using the sling (relating to 1.) if the crampons would already cause you to get flipped, you are already too fast and self-arresting will be really difficult at all Those previous thoughts are all together just a point of view against the default process. In theory this default process works but may be really difficult under real circumstances. Therefore the suggestion was to get you self-arrest really fast or it\\'s very unlikely at all (if you\\'re not roped in). Get yourself in a pushup position, use your hands/fists (always wear gloves!), crampons, maybe also the knees. That being said I don\\'t want to state that this point of view is better or describes the best strategy at all.

       "    'body': \"Summary from a winter spend in Winnipeg long ago compared to Central European conditions: there are probably good reasons why native North American people went with snowshoes while native Europeans invented skis. terrain Snowshoes have advantages over skis in bushy terrain off trail (where long skis become super cumbersome) or rugged terrain. Canadian Shield outside Winnipeg is macroscopically flat, but has rock structure that has you climb up or down a rock every few minutes, and crevices mean that skiing looks somewhat acrobatic meandering between rocks and bushes. OTOH, skis are much better if the terrain is open or there are trails that admit at least quads/snowmobiles: Central European forest paths are fine by ski, and so are the Canadian lakes (once they have sufficiently thick ice) For steep climbing, many modern snowshoes already come with either crampons or teeth at their frame. Of course, there are crampons and skins for ascending for skis as well, but that's mountaineering, not backcountry ;-) If you have long up followed by long down, then ski with skin works well. If its just all the time up and down, putting the skin on and off again takes too long. But V-style/skating/herring bone pattern (don't know the proper English term) ascend a) takes a lot of strength and b) needs a wide trail. snow conditions and temperature If the snow is compact so both skis and snowshoes will stay on top, then skis are much better because they glide. Unless it's actually ice: snowshoes with crampons or teeth in their frame provide easier going on ice. Or the occasional rock. With snowshoes you don't need to worry as much about that occasional rock peeping though the snow. If the snow is deep but not very compact snowshoes require a lot more work because you have to lift them out every step while the ski stays on one level. However, when it is very cold the snow can be so fluffy that also skis just go down (we've had a tour in the Whiteshell where two of us made a trail by snowshoe for the skiers, because they went in to their hip as well) when it is very cold the skis don't glide any more. This happens somewhere between -25 and -30 °C IIRC. Snowshoes still work as always. I remember a ski tour in the Krkonoše where we had had a lot of fluffy new snow with a layer of harsh ice on top. We were with camping backpacks and were breaking through the harsh with every step. But leaving the skis below the surface didn't work, neither because the breaking the harsh with the shin was too hard (and it actually cut). Snowshoes would have been much better there. (raw hide snowshoes need reliable < 0°C conditions: water softens the raw hide so that it will break) Your skills & condition snowshoes work quite intuitively. Put them on and get going. But you are forced to make long and wide steps. If you are not used to this, it can be very exhausting. I was also told that beginners are at risk of inflammation of the inner tendons in the upper leg (the ones that pull your legs together) if they overdo it. skiing requires technique to get efficient. If your skiing techique isn't yet there, that can be quite exhausting as well. somewhat depending on the skis, but if you have XC skis that work well for you with a day tour pack only, their glide zone will be flat (i.e. not gliding/not gliding well) if you carry a camping backpack. Of course, there's a similar trade-off for snowshoes: larger ones provide more floatation but require larger steps and are heavier. You have to decide whether you accept sinking more deeply with heavier backpack or working harder than would be needed when with a small backpack only (there's of course also the option to have more than one pair, and there are add-on tails that provide more floatation). If the terrain is sufficiently open, you can put your backpack into a toboggan/pulkka to avoid this. Also helps when snowshoeing to not sink in as deeply. Toboggan + XC ski downhill does require much better technique. Avoiding decision In the Canadian Shield, we often took both skis and snowshoes and changed every once in a while. As we basically used canoe routes, skis were the major means of going. The additional pair of snowshoes didn't matter on the toboggan (and the terrain is macroscopically flat, so it's not that you think very much of how to carry this additional weight the next 1500 m of elevation gain). As I was a beginner with both, switching back and forth allowed me to get much further, I'm not sure whether I'd have been able to keep up with the experienced members of the group for 20+ km per day otherwise. Costs and random stuff I'd keep in mind for a buying decision From my current home (Frankfurt), both make sense only if you go for winter holidays somewhat regularly. Also snowshoes are easily in the 150 - 200 € category. And bad snowshoes can be super annoying (just like bad skis). Cheaper: some friends bought XC skis they had rented at end of the season. In Central Europe, your chances with used but good stuff are decidedly better for skis than snowshoes. The same goes for end-of-season sale. However, these will typically be cross country skis as opposed to backcountry skis: the narrower variety, typically without steel edge and nowadays also rather short. So they won't provide much floatation in fluffy snow conditions. Chances for backcountry equipment are probably better in regions with more backcountry snowshoeing/skiing (Canada, Scandinavia) I was actually renting the snowshoes, so over the winter I tried out a number of different ones. There were some hard plastic ones that probably would have allowed a bit of gliding and that where considerably lighter than the alu frame plus neoprene variety. But I decided I'd never take them again because they were making noise (clattered like hitting two wooden sticks together) with every single step. It's probably possible to make them less noisy, but they were listed at > 200 CAD... For both skis and snowshoes try out how the binding works with gloves (or even mitts). Automatic ski bindings have a reputation of freezing, so you have to get out of the shoe outside hut/tent... Maybe the additional $€ for the manual ski binding are well invested.\",\n",

As far as using YaxTrax , that is going to be trail and condition dependent. For ridge lines and moderate slopes on good (but somewhat icy trails), I think they would be fine. They are also going to be lighter and more flexible than proper crampons. If, on the other hand, you were planning on climbing steeper ice or deep snow, I would recommend bringing proper crampons. Generally a good idea is to never climb up something you wouldn't feel comfortable climbing down, so you are not over-committed. Trekking poles might be a good thing to bring, and would give you better balance. Also, be sure to practice walking around outside with your chosen footwear + crampon / yaktrak.

It works perfectly fine for exactly the same conditions that would work with cross-country skis, so a gentle uphill will work. His first descent might be a bit slower, but the wax often disappears by the end of the day. The only issue is that you can't easily or efficiently kick with AT boots. I personally have experienced crazy spring conditions where it was 25°C in early march in the Northeast. The snow was so waterlogged that, because of surface tension, I guess, even on slight downhills and flats during ski-out, we needed to kick and glide to gain any forward movement. It definitely works if you can get some grip. As for the herringbone, forget it. The fact that the toes are hinged with no restriction of motion for the skis makes it super difficult and unwieldy. It is possible to cover great distances with an AT kit though. Every winter I go to the Groulx Mountains early February to open a trail to the plateau on frozen streams and it's an almost 20km day-trip out-and-back. But if I'd bring my expedition cross-country kit, I'd shave a lot of time on the ascent and save tons of energy. Now for the meat of the answer: If you want some downhill capabilities, I feel you'd be better served by light plastic or heavy leather telemark boots (think Scott Excursion or Scarpa T3) on a really sturdy Voile 75mm binding setup. For that you need robust skis that can take the pressure of cable bindings and boots, so a bit more than true cross-country skis. Voile has great skis with a grip pattern in the kick zone that can descend well but are light enough that doing long distances isn't a grind.\",\n",

I am going to focus on the position you want to have while going straight, without actively breaking, accelerating or turning - i.e. a \"neutral\" or \"basic\" position. First of all I agree with @Gabriel C. that you should have an active stance. For me this means having body tension, but not being stiff as well as being able to bend and/or straighten your knees when necessary. Second, it is important to have your weight to the front (when skiing on prepared piste). The further your weight is to the front, the more control you have on how your skis behave. You can experience this yourself: try leaning back, and you will see how your skis start to flutter. Lean front, and they will be much more steady. I have seen a lot of beginners that lean to far back, especially when they start to panic. This makes the situation worse, because the skis react worse and worse to their attempts to control them. It might need some confidence to lean forward in a way that would cause you to fall without skis, but just try it out! To achieve the combination of these, it makes sense to bend your knees a little bit (allows you to react to bumps and the like) as well as your hips (allows you to lean forward so you get your weight to the front and control over your skis). It is important not to bend your knees too much though - this would cause your backside to be very low and to the back and can be a difficult position to recover from, depending on the strength of your thighs. See this illustration I shamelessly stole from this site you might want to check out as well: Furthermore (assuming you use carving skis), leaning slightly uphill and putting more weight on the uphill borders of your skis will straighten your course and give you more speed. For turning, I would just push my downhill ski slightly forward and change weight to the downhill edge. I am unsure if I have more weight on one of the skis in the \"neutral\" position, but I think I distribute it quite evenly.',\n",

       "    'body': \"This weekend I was out for the third time on my MSR Lightning Ascent snowshoes. I'm pretty happy with them, particularly the traction on ice or heavy crust. However, the bindings are driving me crazy! The bindings are rubber straps with eyelets. They wrap over your foot, and around a hook with a post that catches in the eyelet. The straps are stretchy, and the tension from the stretch holds the strap in place on the post. The excess strap folds back over, and is tucked into a small clip attached loosely to the root end of the strap. My complaint about the binding is two fold. First, I really have to torque on the straps to hook an eyelet with enough tension to hold it securely on the post. The problem is particularly bad with the heel straps. Second, the excess strap invariably pops out of the tidying clip, and they all end up waving in the air. I then invariably catch the loose strap on something, the strap pops off the post, and I have to stop and re-secure the strap. Has anybody had a similar experience with these bindings, or am I doing something horribly wrong? What can I do to keep the straps fastened securely?\",\n",

That leverage increases the force on your shin and maybe the ankle which might cause harm. If you are wearing snowshoes you are increasing your footprint where those injuries aren't that likely to happen anymore. So far I was lucky not to get injured by that scenario but I think it is quite a likely risk. And of course this is not valid on every terrain.\",\n",

It takes a lot of physical and mental energy to move safely in these conditions - even the most benign snow slope can become treacherous with enough wind. If on the walk out 'get-home-itus' can make you push harder than you might otherwise. The focus must be on the amount of effort you are putting in, not how much (little) you think you should be. I have seen a climber picked up and blown 20 meters by a foehn wind. It does not matter how good a climber you are - if you lifted off the ground the outcome is always going to be down to luck. If the wind is lifting you, you need to consider if you are safe. If not you can then rope up and use a running belay, maybe even a full belay. Worst case is to dig in and wait it out, but make you this decision is made early enough for a successful shelter to be built or found. As far as carrying on, roped or unroped, you need to reduce your wind profile. If you are lucky you can choose a route that allows you to descend with you back to the wind - it will be fast, easy and with the wind no longer in your eyes, you can see where your going so much safer (I have done this and ended up on the opposite side of the mountain from my car and overnight gear, but alive). If you have to climb down into the wind, face into it (Unless no pack, then side on is a lower profile). Squat down rather than lean back or forward. Listen for wind gusts and when you hear one coming, get low quickly, as the gust dies down, move on. Have your ice axe ready at all times and use it for stability. I have ended up crawling for about 100 meters,(which got me to a lee slope). Look for terrain that provide shelter from the wind, but be very wary of lee slopes and assess avalanche risk (all too easy to forget in the joy and relief of getting out the wind).\",\n",

The German Alpine Club (German: Deutscher Alpenverein, DAV) is the world\\'s largest climbing association. The number of members is over one million. (source: \"Deutscher Alpenverein\" ). I will therefore give you the topics which are covered by the glacier courses (courses for alpine tours). The list might seem long but I think it gives you an idea what to look for. 1. Basic course rope up on glaciers crevasse rescue general techniques with ropes, knots and belaying walking with crampons ice axe techniques anchors in ice and firn abseiling self arrest on firn orientation planning routes checking material weather first aid environment and nature protection 2. Advanced course repeat basics going on combined terrain with faces and arêtes climbing (leading and following) belaying in steep rock, firn and ice advanced ice axe techniques hitting pitons return strategies mountain rescue and much more... There are additional courses for crevasse rescue which show the importance of this topic. Avalanche is only a topic in winter courses. I guess they aren\\'t learning the topic of avalanche because it is pretty complex for itself and you are generally trying to avoid situations with a lot of fresh snow in summer. Of course they have avalanche courses but it\\'s not a topic in those glacier courses! My personal advice is to take a course which covers the important points from the basic course above. How to rope up on glaciers is the first thing you have to know and it\\'s not very complicated. But still you should learn the general ideas from a professional (distances long enough to hold possible falls, maybe using knots between members, having rope for a possible crevasse rescue, NOT meeting up when you are doing a break...). Crevasse rescue is also important, I would suggest that you learn at least one method. Under real conditions the rescue might be really tough but having stopped the fall of a companion (or even two) you could still call the mountain rescue services most of the times (still: learn how to rescue someone fallen into a crevasse!). That being said it shows the importance to actually get into this position of braking the fall, setting a deadman and so on. To rope up on glaciers, to be able to belay correctly and to rescue crevasse falls you naturally have to learn some knots. You cover this in the fitting sections of the course. Maybe they don\\'t write those topics explicitly in the description but I am pretty sure all will cover this. Check the course requirements though. Techniques with crampons and ice axes are nice to learn although I don\\'t think they are as important as the security relevant topics mentioned above. What\\'s really important is how to set an ice screw correctly. Still, you will be using crampons in all glacier courses and you will be excited if you do it the first time.

If moisture gets in between those layers (it will), it can cause the various layers of your ski to separate. This process of de-lamination will rapidly destroy your ski or snowboard and can not be repaired. Edge Separation : If the rock catches on your edge enough to pull it out from between the core and base layers, or mangles it enough to create a gap, this can result in several issues: De-lamination (see above), affect turn performance (you have no edge / uneven edge), laceration risk (those things are sharp even when they are in proper position). Fortunately, both of these cases can be repaired to nearly good as new if you have the tools/knowhow -- but only before de-lamination begins, so act quickly.

When climbing hills, your bindings and boots will see on the average a few thousand steps each day. That's thousands of actuations of the pivots in the bindings and the boots. On a resort, your clients would probably leave the boots and bindings locked out most of the day. On the flip side, your clients will be getting more runs in each day, which will likely result in more wear on the bases and edges, but if your clients are sticking to groomed runs, then the wear should be almost negligible. Riding through wild terrain, climbing up and down over stumps and all the other unknowns in the deep snow is where you're more likely to rip a skin or gouge out your bases. As far as safety goes, as long as your AT setups have bindings with DIN settings then you're fine. Ultimately, the wear and tear on your gear will depend largely on its intended use and who's using it.

What we now term alpine skiing was refined in europe, even though there is concrete evidence that it may have originated in asia. Alpine skiing has gone through many changes in technique, but generally speaking: the boot is fixed to the ski at the heel and toe, and turns are performed with the legs parallel which is why they are called \"parallel turns\". Telemark was originated much later in Norway, and is basically a turn that exists as an adjunct to the \"classical\", or \"diagonal stride\" cross country technique, also known as \"kick and glide\". ALL TELEMARK IS NORDIC- and the defining factor is that the heel is ALWAYS FREE. Most people differentiate two types of nordic skiing: \"cross country\" and \"telemark\". Cross country is ideal for covering all grades of terrain in a straight line, and telemark is itself a turn used to gracefully arc down a mountain. And just as a light cross country set up with either wax or scales can get you UP a mountain, so can a modern telemark set up with either wax, skins, or scales. Whether someone is a \"cross country\" or \"telemark\" skier is primarily based on the personal choices of what type of terrain a person wants to ski (mountains, rolling, or flat), and whether they want to focus on covering distance in a straight line or making turns. The new \"adventure\" or \"backcountry\" skier inhabits the demarcation zone between \"classical nordic\", and \"telemark\", and many spend as much time climbing up the mountain as they do shredding it on the way down.',\n",

First - Don\\'t ever travel into uncontrolled avalanche terrain if you have not received proper training from an expert in avalanche conditions, triggers, mitigation, and rescue. It\\'s stupid, seriously you can die, and many people each year do . Second - If you receive training the first thing that you will be taught is to Always wear a transceiver, and know how to use it. It is very possible that your life or that of someone you care about will be saved by a transceiver. Your better off forgetting your ski\\'s or snowboard than your transceiver. Third - Always carry a shovel, avalanche probe pole, and extra clothing when in avalanche terrain. Now that\\'s out of the way Avalanche Overview Information is summarized from the Canadian Avalanche Center Snowpack Layering The snowpack is made of many layers of snow which are formed by climate factors from above the snow, and within the snow. These layers create a stratification of the snow crystals where some adhere more to one another than others. This creates a situation where fractures can occur, and some layers of the snow shift as a unit. The snow \"unit\" causes more snow to fracture in similar ways. This sometimes creates a chain reaction we call an \"Avalanche\" . Types of Avalanches Loose Dry Usually limited to surface layers, and pitches at or above 40 degrees Sometimes called slough, although they can still be very dangerous. Loose Wet Typically form in spring or summer, due to solar radiation (direct sun). Usually require slopes of 30 - 40 degrees to initiate. Wet Slab Generally created by extended periods above freezing. Pinwheeling, snowballing, and loose wet avalanches are predictors Storm snow Caused by a cohesive layer of new snow overloading the sub-surface snow layer bond. Generally avalanches peak during intense snowfall and decrease 24-36 hours following a storm cycle. Wind Slab Caused by wind deposited snow building up and overloading the sub-surface layer\\'s bond. Indicators include \"ribbing\" and \"cornicing\" on leeward slopes. Persistent Slab Caused by a weak bond within the snowpack created weeks, and sometimes months prior to the trigger. Prediction requires digging a snow test pit, reviewing weather logs over weeks and months, and speaking to local experts. Very dangerous avalanches result from \"persistent slab\" conditions. Persistent Deep Slab Caused by a thick, hard, and deep slab of snow loosing it\\'s bond with sub-surface layers. Most commonly caused by early season snowpack being exposed to long periods dry weather. Most common above tree line. Prediction requires digging a snow test pit, reviewing weather logs over weeks and months, and speaking to local experts. Cornice Falls Avalanches caused by large quantities of wind blown overhanging snow fracturing and falling onto a slope. Most common on leeward slopes where a ridgeline breaks the wind. Signs of Unstable Snow Whoompfing - A sound the snow makes (just say the word) when the sub-layer fractures from the surface layer. Sometimes creates shooting surface cracks. Check your underwear in steep terrain, it\\'s scary. Recent Avalanche Activity - Observe the nearby slopes and ridges for activity of sloughing , wet slides, fracturing, or cornacing. Be aware of the environment around you. Always place your head on a swivel. Hollow sounds - While traveling across the snow surface. Stay off steep ridgelines, look for terrain elsewhere. Difficult travel due to breaking through snow layers. If the snow cannot support you while skinning (traveling to and from steep slopes using grippy ski bottoms), it is not stable. Consider lower angles or not skiing that area. Most Common Triggers Environmental Loading from new snow. Temperature or humidity Changes. Human Ski and snowboard travel Snowmobiling Explosives Reducing Avalanche Risk Do not stop or group in exposed areas Do not travel directly above someone in a party. Do not underestimate the danger of a slab avalanche, or how easy they can be triggered. Recognize terrain traps . Do Not travel alone, or apart from your party. Do not become distracted and stay in an exposed place for too long. Good Habits Use releasable bindings Follow low angle slopes Don\\'t box yourself into a region when the slide will be, always have an escape plan. Avoid travel on cornices. Always monitor for environmental signs of avalanche. Watch for decreasing mental judgement, or influence from \"Powder Fever\" . General Avalanche Prediction Note this is by NO means comprehensive, and is only the tip of the iceberg. Check with the local avalanche prediction center Follow historical and current weather, and know how they impact the snowpack. Look for environmental signs of danger. Cracking Ribbing Wind loading Cornicing Tree flagging (where the branches have been sheered off) Nearby avalanche activity Dig snow pits, and test for snow stability.(Outside scope of article) Make local pole tests to check for variation.

Otherwise, the hole just gets bigger and bigger and you exhaust yourself by repeating the procedure. This same principle is behind the ideas of ladders, boards etc. The important part is to distribute the weight on a big area. And if you're really far away from civilisation, calling for help by helicopter or so is obviously a good idea. But I would suggest trying to save the person before doing that, as it is going to take an eternity for the helicopter to arrive compared to how fast you drown when the water is freezing. Just a note: here in Sweden it is very common for schools to teach the basic theory of ice safety, combined with practise. I think going into the water and getting up yourself should be a mandatory prerequisite before going on any serious ice adventure.\",\n",

For hangboarding, you could start even earlier if you wear a harness and attach a weight on the other side of a pulley system to take weight off your fingers.

In the case of alpine/downhill skis, once you have them in hand, rented or bought, the bindings will have been adjusted to release your boot(s) at a pre-determined torsional force, to save your legs from injury. In Europe this is performed according to a published standard. Customers provide their age, height, weight, ability-level and the length of their ski boot, resulting in a calculated \"DIN\" or \"Z\" number. (Charts and calculators abound on the Internet for reference, eg: dinsetting.com .) In the event of an incorrect fall, the store-set Z-number ensures that your boot will be released before your tibia breaks, but perhaps not before knee ligaments are injured. I and some recreational skiers I know choose to reduce our Z-numbers so that the boot is released well before this point, ideally before ligaments can be injured. Eg: for a calculated Z-number of 6, one could reduce to perhaps 3.5 or 4 and be okay on medium-steepness slopes (much of the mountain). Too low and the boot will release when skiing normally, which is also undesirable. Never set above your correctly-calculated value. To adjust the binding Z-number, without the boot engaged, turn each of the large screws at the front and rear of the bindings, and observe the Z-number indicator moving accordingly. Initially, set front and rear of both skis to a lower number. If you pop-out prematurely, increment front and rear of both skis by 0.5 (always set F&R of both skis to the same value).

The trick is to pick the gear that most closely matches your current skills and the terrain you plan to ski. Without knowing more about your situation, I'd suggest spending a season focusing on improving your alpine skills and then maybe look into getting an appropriate AT setup. Learning on AT gear is not really a great idea. The release mechanisms aren't anywhere as near as reliable as regular alpine bindings and the gear is built around the idea that it's for relatively expert skiers who don't fall often. While it may seen cheaper to just get one AT setup, alpine gear is often much cheaper. New AT bindings often twice the cost of basic alpine bindings. It's also much easier to get used alpine gear that is still in good shape. If you decide to stick with it, you can later have AT bindings put on your alpine skis. Or even get a plate that will allow you to switch bindings easily. This question is almost impossible to answer without a lot more details about where and when you are skiing.

Someone with rock climbing experience could certainly top rope on ice or follow an experienced leader with only some brief instructions. The climbing Ice climbing technique is quite different from (most) rock climbing. A rock climber is used to crimp small holds, palm slopers, handjam, and smear feet on slabs. All this is (virtually) absent on ice, where focus is on getting solid placements with your tools, locking off and stay balanced on your feet. I've seen good rock climbers getting completely pumped om basic ice climbs and mediocre rock climbers cruising WI4-WI5 (granted not leading) on their first day on ice. So don't expect climbing skills to transfer. Safety and the mental part This is where it gets really different. Ice climbing is far more dangerous. Some handle this well, some freak out, others don't realize what risks they actually are taking. To start with, while every experienced rock climber is aware of the risk of rock fall, that is not too common. On an ice climb there will be chunks of ice raining down constantly. Dont stand in the fall line while belaying! a big block of ice from 30m above is bad news. Then there is the fact that ice occurs in winter. Ropes will freeze as will biners. And you. You will be wearing gloves. All in all, you will be clumsier. Tying knots and clipping ropes will take more time. Ice screws are good protection if they are placed in solid ice. Problem is, solid ice is not always to be found when you need pro. Be prepared to deal with this before committing to a lead. When I lead on ice, I'm mentally soloing. My pro is a back up, there to keep me alive, not unharmed. Also, placing an ice screw is far more work than clipping a bolt or placing a cam. Placing an ice screw on steep ice, while hanging on to one tool is taxing. So much so that it might often be safer not to place pro and simply run it out until next good rest position. Therefore protection on ice is generally more sparse than on rock. On tho of this, falls are more dangerous, since you have sharp points everywhere that might hurt you in a fall, or your crampons might catch the ice giving you an instant broken ankle. Oh, and beware of avalanche danger. In short: while top roping on ice is not much more dangerous than on rock, things change dramatically once you lead. Some handle this well. Some like it (I do).

       "    'body': \"First, see my comment above. Get some professional instruction. Seriously. To answer your points directly: Build a snow anchor, then transfer the load to your anchor. Holding your partner's weight for the entire duration of a self rescue would be a bad idea. Building an anchor is independent of what your partner is doing. Always build an anchor. On glaciers, you'll most likely build a deadman anchor with an ice axe. It's possible to do a deadman with a ski, but it's time consuming and probably impossible to do alone while holding your partner. Crevasse rescue with a team of two just adds to the complexity. At a minimum, you'll need to be able to arrest the fall, build an anchor, transfer the load, check on your partner, build a haul system, and effect the rescue. Oh, and you'll be by yourself. Most likely, you'll be traveling with knots in the rope. Your best luck for a haul system is a Canadian drop loop (6:1) system. This provides enough mechanical advantage for a single rescuer to pull a victim out. I'll add some references that you should use in addition to professional advice : Alpine Climbing: Techniques to Take You Higher (Houston, Cosley) Freedom of the Hills (Mountaineers books) Glacier Mountaineering, illustrated (Tyson, Clelland) Glacier Travel & Crevasse Rescue (Selters) Unfortunately, Accidents in North American Mountaineering is littered with reports of climbers getting into trouble on glacier because they didn't know how to perform a rescue correctly.\",\n",

Any 4,000 meter peak in the alps is subject to arctic weather conditions with high winds and temperatures far below freezing. There is also going to be very deep snow, so unless you know how to ski or snowshoe, you are going to have a rough time even getting to the real start of the climb. If you've never tried to travel on foot in 2 meters of soft snow, you have no idea of how slow and exhausting it is. On top of that, a 35 degree slope is going to have significant hazards from avalanche. Until you have enough experience to evaluate the local avalanche forecasts and compare them to the conditions you actually see, you should be very conservative in your winter travel. That being said, the Breithorn is considered the easiest 4,000 meter peak in the alps, but it still involves glacier travel and somewhat steep (35 degree) snow slopes.

The key is that ice can support your weight in boots and not yet be safe for dynamic or concentrated loads (i.e. jumping or ice skating). The basic technique is that you first bash the edge of the ice (it is always thinnest at the edge), and look at the thickness underwater. If your bashing put a lot of cracks in the ice or the ice moved on the water, it isn\\'t safe enough to step on. Then you step on the ice -- if it cracks and seems springy, you jump off. Then you jump up and down -- if that\\'s ok, you go out a few feet and look at the ice at slanted angle.

Every professional guide I've ever skied with has warned that tree wells are just as deadly as avalanches. You need to treat tree-wells with the same respect you treat avalanche terrain: Don't ski alone; wear a beacon; carry a shovel and probe; and, know how to conduct an avalanche rescue. It's also recommended to keep an eye on your skiing partner, don't go too far without checking over your shoulder to make sure they're still with you. This way you won't get too far ahead of them incase they do end up in a tree-well. If you fall into a deep well, your very best chance of surviving is to stay calm and grab onto the tree to try and prevent yourself from sinking any deeper. If you can, try to get your skis/snowboard off and get yourself upright. This will expend HUGE amounts of energy, so be wise with every move you make. If possible, you can attempt to climb the tree, but it may be smarter to climb only until you find a pocket of air to breath in, then wait for rescue. This is of course an optimistic best case scenario. I've been head down in tree-wells with skis on before (small ones), any attempts you make to free yourself are absolutely exhausting.

We started with the basics and went backwards over a 30\\' rock wall then I think it was a 90-100\\' rock wall backwards. When you do it the first time, the most unnatural thing was going from standing on the edge and letting the rope through your hands until you were still standing at the edge but now with your body horizontal to the ground and over the edge. We had a safety person at the bottom that would apply tension to the pair of ropes and would prevent us from sliding down if we slipped. I walked down the first wall. I took the second wall in 3 bounces. I got crapped on for being to cautious on wall 1 and then crapped on for taking wall 2 in too large of a bounce. A few years later we were training again on a 50\\' rappel tower. It had a solid wall on one side to go down, and a huge pipe with no wall to simulate going off a helicopter skid.

I did that and just clamped my hand to the rope and let it slam into the small of my back and I waited for me to stop swinging and then I lowered my self to the ground letting the rope slide through my hand. The second time off the helicopter skid was a little more scary. Did it face first. This was with the concept of allowing a free hand to hold a weapon. I dropped straight to the ground. By the time I clamped on to the rope with my hand to stop me, I was too close to the ground for the safety person to apply any tension to the rope. I had too much speed, and my hand hitting me around my abdomen caused me to flip, which resulted in me standing on the ground. I colleagues were really impressed and said that was amazing.

       "    'body': 'Basically this is almost the textbook worst case scenario lacking only on not being hurt, completely alone in the dark and bad weather. To summarize the situation you have a piece of rated webbing you are using as a harness, a single locking carabiner and the rope. The rope is running through a rap ring of unknown strength. While you could try and adjust the lengths of the ropes, the problem is that they need to be unweighted to do it safely because many rap rings can wear through if a weighted rope is pulled through them. Things are even worse since you are using a Munter because if you hold one strand fixed and allow the long strand to move this can saw through the rope. You could attempt to have the strands move at different rates, but this would still cause the weighted rope to run through the rap ring. If you wait until you are very close to the end of the rope, then if you do saw through the rope or rap ring, the fall will not be very far (and you may even make it to the ground). If you do this, make sure you hike back to the top and replace the potentially compromised rap ring. Depending on the exact heights, you might be able to safely rap off the end of the ropes. If the end of the rope is only 10 feet up, your feet will only be 7 feet above the ground when you get to the end of the rope. Hopefully with the additional rope stretch you would make it (or at least be close enough to not get injured in the drop). Being bare foot adds to the risk. The best option is to go up and not down. You can ask the person on the ground to tie some extra gear onto the long end of the rope (a couple of slings and carabiners is all you need). That said, you have enough gear to rescue yourself since you are using a swiss seat harness made from webbing (if you were in a modern harness and alone, I think you are screwed). The key is to use the webbing from your harness to create a klemheist and the carabiner from the Munter to ascend the rope. Of course you have to first free up the webbing. To get the webbing, you need to create a second swiss seat harness from the running end of the rope. Then use some extra rope to saw through the webbing harness (bet you wish you had a small knife). Depending on how tight the second swiss seat is, you will fall a little. All of these steps could be eliminated if you had a piece of webbing or cord (maybe from your chalk bag). Once you have the webbing make a klemheist and a foot loop (if needed, use some more rope). Push the klemheist high, step up, clip in with the carabiner, sit down, repeat. You should tie in short frequently since otherwise when you open the carabiner to reclip in, you will be out of the system (a second carabiner would be super helpful here).',\n",

The issue here is that a sprained ankle is not going to immediately kill anyone however a botched attempt to winch them up a cliff very well could. As soon as you start they are in a significantly more dangerous situation than they were at the bottom and if they suddenly deteriorate it is much more difficult to stabilise their condition. You could also set yourself up for legal liability. If someone is climbing they take responsibility for the fact that they are undertaking a dangerous activity. By contrast in an amateur rescue attempt the casualty may not be in a position to give informed consent for what you are trying to do. Much better is to make sure you have the equipment to contact the emergency services reliably as well as satellite phones there are various beacon systems designed for exactly this sort of situation. Similarly up to date first aid training and equipment to stabilise a casualty untill help arrives is probably a better investment of effort. Even if you did get training in rope rescue techniques, unless that is backed up by a degree of experience and regular practice there is a good chance that you will make a dangerous mistake in the heat of the moment. Probably the worst case is that you have a casualty with a suspected spinal injury (which seems a distinct possibility in the scenario you describe) in which case you don't want to move them at all unless it is to get them out of real imminent danger It may be that the local fire or ambulance service can give you some more detailed advice which takes into account the facilities available in the area.\",\n",

Climb the fence, with at least one hand on the fence post and your feet one the wires, in between the barbs, as close to the post as reasonable. Being close to the fencepost minimizes the chance of you breaking the fence and is more stable. With your other hand either hold the wire, being careful not to grab a barb, or put both hands on the fencepost. When you are sufficiently high swing one leg over being careful not to catch yourself on the top barbs and place your foot in the fence on the other side. Either twist your foot around or put your heel in on the wire if you are less flexible. Carefully get your other leg over and climb or jump down. This method is easiest for lowish fences where you can just take one step on the fence and get your leg over. I wouldn't do it for anything over about 4 1/2 ft as the top of the fence may get quite unstable when you put your weight on it at that height. The disadvantages of this approach is that it is quite easy to catch your leg/crotch on the top wire and rip your trousers as you don't want to climb higher than necessary (climbing higher is less stable). Also if you feel you are losing balance don't grab the barbed wire, jump off. It may sound obvious but your natural reaction is to steady yourself and the wire is generally the most obvious thing to grab.\",\n",

If not, then back to the drawing board. Most ziplines have raised ends, with one end lower. The uphill on the downhill end slows down the person. A lighter person tends to travel more slowly, and may stop short of landing point. This can be adjusted by shortening the cable, moving the low point closer to the landing point. Conversesly a heavy person may come down too fast and slam into the stop at the end. Put more slack in the cable. You can also form a bumper by slitting a hollow core pool noodle, wrapping the bottom end of the cable with it, and then wrapping the noodle with fiber reenforced tape. This gives a 6 foot bumper. Again, test thoroughly. An old matress for 3 on the post at the bottom is also a good idea. Perodically schedule an inspection: Check the slider axles for wear, the cable for wear, the cable splices at the ends, the attachments to the supports at the ends, the landing area.

       "    'body': \"To start with, each situation will be different. E.g. if you have an overhang and your partner is hanging freely in space, you may need to handle things a bit differently. Lowering an unconscious leader is also dangerous, as lower-angle terrain can exacerbate their injuries, and getting them caught on an unseen ledge could introduce slack. Also, if you have a sufficiently strong tag line, tying it to the end of the rope and removing some of the lower pieces of protection may allow you to lower the leader down. I suggest viewing the various self-rescue skills as a toolkit, from which you assemble a plan for each situation. Escaping the belay is one of many tools you have to work with. Some of the basics you should be well-practiced in include: Locking-off and escaping the belay Tandem and counterbalance rappels Transferring loads between the rope and anchor Ascending a rope Roped-solo techniques Basic first aid Passing a knot Rigging hauling systems The scenario mentioned is particularly dangerous since you have no idea if the top-most piece is still safe to climb on. (The original fall might have nearly pulled it out.) For a very general solution, I'd suggest the following steps: Assess the situation and make a plan. Is there anyone else who can help? Is there an easier way to get above the leader? Is the leader conscious? Escape the belay and beef up your anchors. Make any necessary adjustments to your anchor (e.g. for direction of pull). If the leader is still conscious, they may be able to place additional protection or give you more information. Get to your leader. As mentioned, you don't know how secure the rope is. If you have a second rope you may want to consider roped solo techniques. Alternatively you can ascend the rope. Fix any immediate life threats, (although anything that serious will probably already have killed them). Construct a proper anchor and transfer the leader's weight to it. You will likely need to return to the bottom anchor to lower them onto the new anchor. Once this is done, you can return to the leader to set up a lower or rappel. Administer any needed first aid and re-assess your plan. If this new anchor is sufficiently low, it may allow you to do a tandem rappel to the original belay station. Otherwise, you may want to lower them first. Reference: Climbing Self Rescue: Improvising Solutions for Serious Situations\",\n",

In which case, the simplest thing to do– without leaving any gear behind –is to rappel as if you were descending a multi-pitch sport climb. Tether to the top anchor, feed your rope through the hangers/rap station at the top to the half way point of your rope, knot your rope ends with triple barrel knots, and rappel down to the lowest anchor that you can. Then, tether to that anchor, pull your rope and repeat. If you concerned about rappelling off of only one bolt, first remind yourself that your body is more likely to snap in half than your bolt is to pull out of the rock (supposing whoever set the anchor did it properly), if that doesn't settle your nerves, then just feed your rope through two adjacent intermediate anchors on the wall . You can accomplish this at least two different ways: The first requires that you have three times as much rope as there is distance between two anchors. As you pass one anchor, feed one of the free ends of your rope through the hanger, then continue rappelling to the next bolt. Tether to that anchor, go off rappel, then feed the same free end through the bolt you're anchored to. Tie your descender back into your rope and you're effectively rappelling off of a backed up anchor. If you guess your distance wrong and end up not having enough rope to do #1, then simply tether to the anchor, pull your rope, rappel down to the next anchor, tether off again , feed a free end of rope through that hanger, then pass the anchor with your rappel device before continuing. It's not as safe as #1, because it's more steps and takes more time, but chances are you're only up one or two bolts from the bottom at this point anyways, so your fall potential is a lot less severe.\",\n",

Climbing the wrong way and getting stuck without a way out due to being pulled by the rope is quite a common thing to happen. If that does not resolve the situation just as mentioned, proceed as in an improvised rescue: Start improvising. If you have enough rope, lower yourself down to establish contact. If you cannot abseil far enough as the rope is too short, you can lower on the rope the second is climbing on. Just use the exact same technique as in ascending on a rope: Two blocking knots, one attached to your harness, the other as a descending aid. Non strategic protections can just be unclipped, otherwise you may need to do a blocking knot below and then untie the one on top, but with some fiddling you might even slide it through the biner of the protection. It is slow, cumbersome and tiring, but an option to descend on a taught rope if nothing else works.

All of the stuff that Kai K. has recommended I would assume you already knows without being told. In my mind, the piece about commando rappelling (very serious climbers do not do this) seems dangerous. I have been climbing in Yosemite seriously for over a decade and ascended all of the major walls there, so my experience is deep. In all those years, I have never met climber(s) that would do this on a cliff this size. Since I have done this type of repelling before, I see additional points to stress: If the overhang is severe enough, one issue is being able to stay in contact with the wall. If you bounce or push off the wall with enough force such that you come in contact with the wall again, then it will be easier for you to clip an anchor. If you lose contact with the wall, you could be left in midair which will requires take time and energy to get you back. If the anchor has no slings, it could be tricky to find them. With large cliff faces as you’ve shown, I would have a daisy chain ready to clip in to an anchor in the case that there are no slings to grab. I have been in situations where I was not been able to find anchors and was force to use jumars (or ascenders) to go back up the rope. This is no small feat if you have not practiced it. If you haven’t, I strongly recommend that you do this by finding a high bridge, tying off a rope and ascending up the rope using jumars. Of course, the best practice in all climb excursions is being able to self-rescue yourself. Good luck to you.',\n",

But that\\'s a huge, colossal if , especially given your use case. So here comes the party-pooper... As long as you are even moderately well prepared I would be willing to bet a lot of money that the odds of \"I\\'m in a The Great Outdoors survival situation where I need to jump 100 feet off a cliff into water\" are very slim. I think you\\'re more likely to get struck by lightning on a clear day where no signs of lightning were present (supposedly, that happens). Originally I was much stronger in my wording. But thanks to @BlackThorn for pointing out there are use cases similar enough to what the question asks for that they should also be seriously considered. BlackThorn wrote: Fire on a cruise ship, fire on an aircraft carrier, friend falls off of cliff and you want to rescue him before he drowns (and you jump because you are confident you can survive the fall to rescue him). The last example literally happened to a friend of mine with an 80 foot cliff and he saved his life, holding his friends face above the water until paramedics arrived. Ship Fire Even if there is a fire on a ship, that doesn\\'t mean you\\'re likely to be forced to jump from the top, but that could be a possibility. If you are on a tall ship and concerned about fire safety, a safer strategy would be to review the ship\\'s fire evacuation routes and procedures. In case of fire, a smart evacuation is better than a frantic high jump. Cliff Rescue In the case of a friend falling from a cliff, again, that does not automatically mean someone should immediately jump in after them, especially if you don\\'t know the safety situation at the bottom. In all emergency rescue situations, you need to ensure your own safety as well otherwise you endanger both yourself and the other person. If a friend falls from a cliff, do not immediately jump over after them. As quickly as you can, scan the bottom for safety hazards. Wait a second to see what is happening to the person who fell as well. I am happy for BlackThorn\\'s friend that the outcome was favorable. However, this anecdotal evidence does not mean you should throw logic to the wind, and hopefully the heroic friend performed the rescue safely. An 80 to 100 foot fall takes between 2-3 seconds according to a quick Google query. Human reaction time means that a rescuer is likely to be at least a second or two behind to begin with. At that point you might as well wait the 1 second to see how the victim lands since they might not even need rescuing. And if you are wearing any very cumbersome clothing you should remove it first: I know some of my boots would make it impossible to perform a water rescue in, so taking even 10 seconds to remove them would be better than jumping in with them on. So work quickly to save the person, but don\\'t rush to the point of making the situation worse. The old \"hurry up and wait.\" It has also happened that people jumping from heights into water have landed on a person at the bottom and killed them. It would be a tragic accident if a heroic effort to save someone who would not have died anyway led to both the victim and the hero dying together in vain. If you are absolutely sure that this is actually necessary, then jump in like a rigid vertical pencil. Realistic possibility of survival jump The \"jump off a cliff to survive\" trope is exciting but not realistic. Maybe this question was inspired by a scene I\\'ve heard about where Bear Grylls supposedly did something similar and made some people thing it was a reasonable survival tactic. I haven\\'t seen the scene myself. This use case is simply not realistic and is a dangerous view of wilderness survival. Even if you create a highly contrived scenario where you make it seem like this is the best option, I would still take my chances sitting tight and doing my best on the high ground. Your survival odds are likely higher. Even if you are severely dehydrated and need the water at the bottom of the cliff, in that case I still might stay up top. To be so dehydrated that you would risk the jump means you\\'re probably also so dehydrated that you 1) aren\\'t thinking as clearly and are more likely to make bad choices, and 2) lack the coordination and strength to perform the jump technique well and will have even higher odds of severe injury or death. \"I still want to prepare for this rare situation anyway!\" Ok, then here\\'s what you can do that will benefit you way more. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Predators: To deal with predators bring defenses and learn to use them.

Forest fire: You might still be at risk at the bottom of the cliff. You might also make it harder for rescuers to find or reach you by making such a change to your location. Wilderness Survival: Everyone needs to get the idea out of their head that such risky actions are a part of real wilderness survival training. If you\\'re in a wilderness survival situation, you need to avoid such risks at all costs. Out of all the rare cases where you might otherwise be tempted to jump, in most of them you would probably be better served by bringing bear spray and bringing an emergency locator beacon to signal for help and let rescuers know your location. Climbed up a rock face and dropped your gear? Activate your beacon. Realize a forest fire is nearby? Activate your beacon. Being hunted or attacked? Active your bear spray. Any other situation where you don\\'t have to jump right this second ? Active your beacon. \"But what if the beacon fails?\" That\\'s possible, sure, but what are the odds that will happen coinciding with an animal attack coinciding with a cliff-you-animal sandwich, coinciding with survivable water at the bottom of it? Not convinced? Get a second beacon as a back up. Think ahead for situation-specific emergency backups, like an emergency waist pack with an extra rope and/or beacon. Similarly, if this is a concern plan for it before a trip where you\\'re around cliffs: What could go wrong, and how could I mitigate that so I wouldn\\'t have to jump? Summary Don\\'t jump! Just bring defenses and a beacon and plan ahead, as mitigating the situation beforehand has much higher chance of success than dealing with it after. If you do somehow manage to have no choice at all but to jump, and you decide to jump despite your terrible luck at this point, then look to the other answers and pencil drop in straight and rigid.',\n",

You have to break the surface tension with a part of your body that can take the blow, and you have to keep all your muscles clenched and your body absolutely rigid, and you have to hit absolutely perpendicular to the surface. If you do it wrong, you are likely to be knocked unconscious and drowned. I do it head first, which means keeping the hands locked together in a double fist, elbows and shoulders locked and rigid, hands directly between the top of head and the water, spine absolutely straight. Do not bend your neck to try to look at the water! If your arms are not locked and rigid your fists will hit your head and knock you unconscious or your arms will be ripped back and dislocated and the water will knock you unconscious. It can also be done feet first, which means keeping the knees locked, all muscles in legs, thighs and butt absolutely clenched rigid, heels sharply pointed down, looking straight ahead and hitting the water again perpendicular to the surface. If your feet spread you will crush your genitalia, and if you're male will require medical treatment. If you do not clench your butt you may intake water with damaging force. If you look down you will get smacked in the face hard enough to break your nose and possibly knock you out. I did it wrong once, and hit at an angle instead of perpendicular. Striking the water felt like hitting concrete. My left arm was ripped backwards, completely dislocating the shoulder. I was knocked unconscious and concussed. The rapid compression of my chest ruptured my left lung and my legs were temporarily paralyzed, perhaps by the impact to my spine or skull. Although I survived, my body was permanently damaged by the injury - my left shoulder dislocates more easily than my right, and I have a scar tissue mass in my lung from the haemothorax.\",\n",

On a summer camp, I assume that the kids wouldn\\'t be trusted to set up a rapell by themselves anyway, so that is not a problem for your story. As for the actual rapell, a one-armed person would have trouble handling a more advanced assisted-braking type device (where you would need one hand to control the device and another to hold the rope). A simpler device (tube style or figure eight) however would work just fine. Usually, while rapelling, you attach a prussik loop to the rope as a backup, which would be manageble (once set up by an instructor) with one hand. However, if I was the instructor here, I would use what is called a \"firemans belay\". That is simply someone standing at the bottom holding the ropes being ready to pull on them (engaging the brake) if the rapelling kid loses control. Additionally, a chest harness with a carabiner clipped to the rope might be a good idea, helping to keep the rapelling kid upright. Another option would be for an instructor to rapell with the kid.

I'll describe one specific method, using cheap gear, that is based on techniques that I've used in rock climbing. Buy: a short length (maybe 20 m) of 9-10 mm static climbing rope a small amount (maybe 10 m) of tubular webbing a small amount of 6 mm accessory cord a locking carabiner a rock-climbing/mountaineering helmet Prepare a diaper harness made from tubular webbing, tied with a water knot . You can find instructions for this in various places, such as the mountaineering textbook Freedom of the Hills. Clasp it using the locking carabiner. Prepare two slings made out of the utility cord, tying them with a secure knot such as a double fisherman's bend . Throw the rope over a sturdy branch. Using one of the slings, tie a Prusik around both strands, put it into the locking carabiner on your harness, and lock the carabiner. Tie another Prusik lower down. Carefully dress and test the Prusiks, since you're going to trust them to hold your weight. Put your feet into the bottom Prusik. Ascend the rope by alternately putting your weight on one Prusik and sliding the other up the rope. To descend, you can either reverse the process or rappel on a Munter hitch . If you're going to rappel, read the chapter in Freedom of the Hills on rappelling, and set up a Prusik backup as described there, as well as following the other safety precautions described, such as tying backup knots on the ends of the rope. If you mess up any of the techniques, e.g., by not tying one of the knots correctly, then you could fall and get hurt or killed. Ditto if you rappel without a backup and your hand goes off of the rope. For these reasons, you would be well advised to practice at home with a friend who can provide you with a belay on a second rope. While you're at the top of the climb, you may want to use a separate sling to anchor yourself, so that if you slip, you can't fall to the ground. If space in your pack is really at a premium, then you could reduce the length or diameter of the rope. A shorter rope will reduce the height to which you can climb, and may also make you more vulnerable to rappelling off the end of your rope, which can be a deadly mistake. A smaller diameter rope may be more easily damaged, and there is probably a limit on how small you can go and still have the Prusiks and munter work.\",\n",

Grade I or below Most Grade I scrambles are within the range of anyone who is competent in the mountains. Above this you need more skills.

Grade II/III and climbing This isn\\'t totally inaccessible you just need take a bit of time to learn scrambling rope techniques, how to belay, etc. you can still do this. You will likely need some more kit and you will need to learn how to use it (i.e. harnesses and belay plates and some kind of protection such as nuts). Your local climbing wall is probably where you start with this, most have beginner courses that will teach your how to belay, etc. You then need to learn to place the gear and protect the climb. But scrambling is a really good place to learn to climb and improve your confidence. But learn the basics somewhere safe (indoors) first! There are a series of British Mountaineering Council videos covering the subject in detail at some points it mentions the idea of using a hand line on some more exposed routes to give something to hold on to....Presumably, the most able climber in the group would go forward and anchor a rope along the route for other climbers in the party to use? This isn\\'t a technique I\\'m familiar with, plus I don\\'t really see the benefit. If someone isn\\'t confident they either shouldn\\'t be there at all or should be properly secured for their safety. Couple of issues here: A rope is really unpleasant to hold. If you fall and hold the rope, expect serious burns. If you fall what are the chances of you catching the rope? for that reason I\\'d prefer to use a different technique: I used a figure of eight lasso (passed under the armpits of the person) to secure the people and I either belayed off spikes or hip belayed . The rope\\'s main job was to give the person confidence, but in the unlikely event that they do fall, I could catch them without relaying on them holding onto something. If the pitches are quite long, then you probably want harnesses. I\\'m wondering if you mean like on a via ferrata?

You will be rappelling on single bolts, so you should know how to judge their quality: (Tell the belayer to put a knot into the end of the rope, if not done yet.) Rappel down from the next bolt until you reach a lower one where the rope would be long enough. Fix yourself to that one, retrieve the rope, rappel to the ground. Depending on the quality of the bolts (sharp edges etc), you might have to leave behind a biner or two, or some cord. This answer assumes that you are comfortable with rappelling down from a single bolt. (In my area, bolts are generally really good, and some top anchors even consist of single bolts.) This trick might save you from having to leave behind stuff if the two rappelling sections are at most 1/3 of your rope length each (though the use of a screw link is a highly controversial practice and I personally wouldn't do it if the anchors look solid enough): Warning: The sling/cord will suffer from the rope being dragged through it. The purpose of this method is to avoid leaving behind any stuff, such as quick links that could become rusty and block critical bolts. You probably wouldn't want to use the sling after using this method.\",\n",

Also edited to add: It's not as easy as you might think - in my experience, if you do it right, making yourself as hydrodynamic as possible, a simple jump off the side of a pool (~ 1 ft / 30 cm) into the water can get you to the bottom of a dive pool (~20 ft / 6 metre) pretty handily, so there's a real risk of breaking bones jumping from any substantial height into water, even if it is quite deep.\",\n",

You do it in steep and/or difficult terrain. Moving continuously being roped together while the first uses gear Using e.g. a tibloc or you can use rocks to let the rope move behind them (with respect to the side so in case of somebody falling, the rope will cause friction and the weight of different rope partners slowing down the fall - this is more likely done on ridges and not on a face like in the picture) Being comfortable and without big technical difficulties (in respect to the skills of each person in the party) this earns a lot of speed. This is often done in steep ice or on easier to medium difficult rock climbs (common e.g. on UIAA III or IV climbs) Moving without protection being roped together Is typically done on glacier hikes where the main risk is falling into a crevasse. If there is no risk of crevasses, this can only make sense if you walk e.g. on a snow ridge where you have no possibility to use protection: In case one falls, the roped-in friend has to react very fast and jump on the other side of the ridge. This is very difficult and therefore needs experience. I was told this should only be done by mountain guides going behind the client. Moving without protection not being roped together No backups. You have to feel absolutely comfortable with the terrain you are moving in. For me it looks very unlikely to have hidden crevasses in the terrain seen in the picture. So for option (3) it is much more likely that the roping together introduces a much higher risk here than going without rope. Especially if you tie in 5 people (!) it is not very likely that the members will hold the party if somebody falls. It will be more like a chain reaction with very fatal consequences, not only for the one who falls, but for the whole party. I once was guided in South America on rocky terrain in a five-member party without using protection. For me this is similarly a no-go but the guide said it's OK and he does it all the time. For me this is not the way to move in the mountains, but opinions differ. I say you use one of the options (1), (2) or (4) depending on how comfortable you feel in respect to the experience and skill level of all (!) members of the party. If you can't find a conclusion the way to react is: don't ascend further - return to a route which is safer for your group. For me it seems that the wall is not that steep so that option (1) is too slow. Especially if you only have 1 rope for 5 people. So I would either search for spots to use mobile protection to place a camelot or nut. Or I would try to find rocks to guide the rope properly - descriped in (2).

In your situation, I would avoid the railing completely as you just do not know much about the material and its strength. Instead I would either do a counter balanced rappel or rely on an unanchored belay. The Needles in South Dakota is/was famous for its spires with no anchors at the top. This Climbing article mentions the basic technique, one person raps off one side while the other person raps off the other side. If there are two balconies on opposite sides of the building you could easily do this. Safer would be to run the rope through the entire building, down the other side and treat it something like an odd toprope with the anchor person standing on the ground. If you cannot get the rope through the whole building in a fairly straight line, go with a unanchored belay. The use of unanchored belays based solely on a secure stance are fairly common in mountaineering situations. They are mentioned by the AAI , Sierra Club and Climbing Magazine . In rock climbing, a good seated stance with the rope running between two boulders and your legs straddling the gap is very secure. Even if you get pulled out of your stance, your body becomes a giant chock stone. The ideal setup would be something like running a long piece of webbing through the apartment, out and under the front door (which should be closed), and connected directly to the \"anchor\" person. The anchor person could sit outside the front door with their feet braced on either side. If you really want you can equalize the anchor between two people. The anchors just sit there wearing a harness with the rappel rope tied into them. They are not belaying. The further the rope/webbing runs along the ground the more friction and less pull on the anchor person. In terms of forces, the situation is similar to lowering someone from the top directly off your harness. The actual forces will depend on how smooth the lowering/rappelling is. While ideally you would be backed up to an anchor, most people can lower a climber without being pulled from a good stance.',\n",

If your rope doesn't reach the ground you will have to down-aid by placing gear to stay close to the wall in order to set up for another rappel.

If you don't know how to do that, or you didn't bring prussics or ascenders, you will be stuck . Sadly this happens more commonly than one would think...

It is not safe to climb over a barbed wire fence. Neither is safe to climb a fence post. The first carries a high probability of being snagged on barbs and the second carries a high risk of staple/nail/wire failure, resulting in injury to the hiker. Both of these methods will also potentially damage the fence or the post. This leaves two methods for safely crossing the fence - between the wires, or under the bottom wire . If the wires are loose enough to easily spread apart, then it is possible to safely cross between the wires: Option #1 - Crossing between the wires: Using both hands, lift all of your gear over the fence, one piece at a time (backpack, walking stick, etc.), and place or drop gently on the far side. Do this near a fence post so there is no danger of tripping over any of it when crossing. Then go to the middle point between two fence posts where there is the most slack in the wires. Stand next to the fence, facing down the fenceline (so either your right or left side is nearer to the fence than the other). Pick a wire that is just above the height of your hip - this is the wire to go under. You don't need to touch this one. Firmly grasp the wire directly beneath that wire, with both hands, and push down. Don't push hard and don't put your weight onto it - just push it down a few inches to allow room to pass between the wires. Cross between the wires: Moving in a slow, smooth motion (remember, you're already bending forward to hold the lower wire down), lift the leg nearest to the fence upward, behind you (heel up, toe down), and gently swing the entire leg through. Immediately lower your upper body (remember - already bent forward) to horizontal and swing through the wires. Then follow with the second leg. Just imagine bending forward and taking a high step to the side (by swinging the leg back and up) with the second leg following in an identical high step. Remember to move slowly and maintain your balance. If a barb snags your clothing, stop, reverse directions and move back a few inches, lower that portion of your body a little more (or raise, depending on which wire snagged you), and try again. If the wires are strung too tightly for you to easily spread them sufficiently to fit through, then you cannot safely cross between the wires. Then try option #2 below. Option #2 - Crawl under the bottom wire. Follow the fenceline, first one direction, then the other, looking for a low spot beneath the bottom wire. When you find one that you think you can squirm through, then lift your gear over (same as in Option #1 above), return to the depression, get on your belly, and crawl/scoot/squirm (whatever works for you!) under the bottom wire. If neither option will work for you, then do not cross the fence! Look for a gate - while looking for a gate, keep your eyes open for a spot where Option #1 or Option #2 might work.\",\n",

In Marine Corps boot camp about 15 years ago I remember one of the instructors demonstrated in dramatic fashion how safe rappelling on the tower was due to the presence of a belayer below. The instructor took a flying leap off the tower and the belayer was able to stop his fall. Given that free fall is about as fast as you\\'re going to fall, the rappel was on a single rope, we used the same rope that the instructor used, and no one died, this is reasonably safe (given a strong anchor). The problems I see are more related to less than ideal anchors and rope wear. Zipping down the rope is going to produce more friction and wear out your rope faster. Do it enough and fast enough your rope might even get a \"glazed\" look to it as the nylon fuzz on the sheath has been melted off. Secondly if you come to an abrupt stop on a fast decent you will shock load the anchor. This is especially true if you use static ropes. That shock load isn\\'t friendly to your rope, the anchor, or your body. Overall, yes I think you can zip down ropes if you want, but please don\\'t do it on my rope. :) I\\'m pretty sure we were using carabiner wraps to rappel in boot camp, but it might have been figure 8\\'s.',\n",

I want to add that I am in no way endorsing this for climbing or prolonged use beyond a static hang or an emergency situation. I\\'ve heard and read that rope/webbing harnesses can be quite painful and can possibly cause injury if someone were to fall in them, due to lack of padding. The first way I found is from the American Alpine Institute blog , which, half-way down the page mentions the diaper sling shown below, and then another alternative called the Swiss Seat shown in a Youtube video or similarly here . The next is called a Diaper Sling. From here : Diaper Sling You\\'ll need one piece of 1-inch tubular webbing. The length will vary depending on the size of your waist and thighs but 12-feet is usually plenty. Create a loop out of the sling by tying the ends together with a Water Knot. With the loop horizontal (parallel to the ground) run the top half of the loop across the small of your back, and the lower half of the loop below your buttocks. Keep the knot towards the front so that it is smooth against your back and thighs. Then, reach between your legs, to grab the lower loop and pull it in between your thighs. Keep holding on to the original loop! Finally, clip the whole mess together. Ta-da.... you have created a diaper sling. I used the instructions to create a test diaper sling myself, and it seems like it would hold me, but if i really needed a harness I\\'d probably opt to spend the time making the Swiss Seat. As I mentioned above, mountaineering harnesses can be little more than stitched webbing with some added thickness which might be a better alternative if this is going to be more than a one time use. One last comment addressing your question. I don\\'t know your exact use case, but using rope while crossing streams/rivers is generally risky business. For example , \"The two hikers had tied themselves onto a rope that had been placed across the stream earlier this summer. They lost their footing and were pulled under by the current.\" Though there are techniques to use rope and anchors to successfully cross streams/rivers, when misused the rope can get pulled into the water, creating lots of drag and usually taking whoever is attached right off their feet. You might be quite experienced with this, so I\\'m just leaving this as a general fair warning.',\n",

Another simple solution would be to bring radios in the future, but that doesn't help you in this case. I assume you didn't each have a cell phone in your pack. If you've exhausted the simple options (say it's been an hour and nothing is happening), this becomes more of a self-rescue situation, and self-rescue is based on improvising a solution using the gear you have and the techniques you know. Often in self-rescue, lowering the climber is the easiest solution. It would have worked here, but you had no way of knowing that, and it could have been dangerous to lower. So... If you were giving her a direct belay, then tying off the belay is trivial. If you were belaying off of your harness, then you need to know how to escape the belay, which is an important and fundamental self-rescue skill to practice. If you had less than half the rope out, then you could rappel down on a second strand to see what was up. However, you would need to formulate a plan to make sure you could get back up without having to solo the route, e.g., using a Prusik. The decision whether to attempt this might depend on the difficulty of the route. Because you can't extract your belay device from the system, you would need to do the rappel using an alternate technique such as a Munter. Another option might be to go and get help. Obviously that has disadvantages, but it beats attempting a self-rescue by a sketchy method that might get you killed.

       "    'body': \"A very important point here is rappelling/abseiling is the most dangerous part of a climb . You're very exposed, typically relying on your rope alone and whatever you're anchored to and nothing else, your backups are minimal. An accident at this point is more likely to be serious or even fatal at this point then any other point on your climb. So most climbers do whatever they can to mitigate these risks. If you want to not do this to save some time (the only upside to rappelling at the same time is that it's faster), then that's up to you. Rappelling at the same time is more dangerous than standard rappelling, this is highlighted in this accident report http://www.rockandice.com/climbing-accidents/climber-killed-in-simul-rappelling-accident-on-the-goat-wall . Here the people rapelling ended up in this situation: /|\\\\ x| | | | | | | y So y had reached the base of the cliff. He naturally unweighted the rappel. This caused a sudden shift in the rope though his device that he wasn't expecting. Unfortunately the rope came out of his device entirely and this caused the fatality of x (a fall of around 300 feet+). There were likely mitigating factors here, y didn't have any backups (prusik) and they should have rappelled at the same distance keeping the rope even. But it does highlight an extra complexity that can be mitigated simply by rappelling individually. Here's another accident where one person has again lost the rope. http://www.rockandice.com/climbing-accidents/simul-rappel-goes-tragically-wrong-reed-s-pinnacle-yosemite this article also contains some prevention information: This accident would have been prevented if the climbers had tied knots in the ends of the rope before rappelling. Note, however, that knotted ends will not always prevent rappelling accidents. For example, on rappels where the rope ends reach the ground or a ledge, losing control could still result in a ground/ledge fall. A safer method involves both knotting rope ends and using a hands-free backup such as a prusik hitched on the rope below your rappel device, as shown in the photo here. Simul-rappelling is rarely necessary —perhaps the only time it is actually required is to descend a spire where there is no anchor, and climbers must rappel different sides to get down. Simul-rappelling also presents extra risks. It increases the load on the anchor—a consideration in scenarios where you’re rapping on old fixed pitons, bolts or gear that could fail under high loads, such as those generated when two climbers jounce down uneven terrain simultaneously. Also, if the two climbers are using different devices or one of them is significantly heavier than the other, the rope might be differentially loaded, allowing more slack to slip through the anchor on one side and causing the rope ends to become uneven. The real danger in simul-rappelling, though, as evidenced by this fatal accident, is that if one rappeller unweights his side of the rope, either by reaching the ground or a ledge ahead of his partner or by losing control of his brake hand, the rappeller on the other side of the rope will free fall. Avoid any scenarios where you unnecessarily place your life in the hands of another. In this case, David could simply have tied off the rope and rapped on a single line using his Grigri, then John could have rigged for a double-rope rappel. Or, knowing that the 80-meter rope was long enough, John could have, after leading, simply lowered from the anchor (quicklinks and rings) and belayed David up using a slingshot toprope. According to Accidents in North American Mountaineering in 2013, rappelling accounts for a high percentage of climbing fatalities every year. Hedge your bets by practicing safe rappelling: knot your ropes, use a hands-free backup and take responsibility for your own safety. I remember reading another incident (can't find the article) where a mitigating factor was the use of a gri gri. Again the people rappeling we're uneven and this caused one of the gri gri's to slip. The unevenness accelerated the rope slip though the gri gri and again one person died. I'd say simul-rappelling is actually safer than standard rappelling, since both climbers need to be balanced on the rope (using their braking devices) before lowering themselves. This is exactly why it's not safer, both climbers need to be balanced on the rope , at all times, evenly, or else someone falls. If your on your own you have control of both ropes and it's even because it's just you controlling both at the same time.\",\n",

To start with try and get help as much as you can - for instance shouting for help if there are any other climbers nearby. Get them to phone immediately for help (e.g. Mountain Rescue if available). If there are other climbers about, then you should have access to more rope and gear hopefully. Ensure you can escape the system safely and also ensure that the injured climber remains safely belayed. If it is possible, safely gain the top of the crag and abseil down to the injured climber. I would say the priority is to safely get access to the injured climber and carry out the basic ABC's (Airway with C-Spine control if possible, Breathing, Circulation) of First Aid and ensure their airway is not compromised and that they are able to breathe (for example they haven't been caught by a sling around the neck and are being strangled or maybe their mouth or jaw was injured an compromised the airway). If there is a lot of bleeding from a wound try and apply some sort of bandage so that pressure can be applied to help stop the bleeding. If they are unconscious, there is a problem known as Harness Suspension Trauma where if an individual is being suspended motionless in a harness there is a chance of death after a relatively short time. So there is an urgent need in this case to get the injured climber in a position where they are no longer being suspended motionless in a harness (e.g. lowering to the nearest ledge or the ground if possible).

Read here for more information on locking Italian Hitch: http://www.climbing.com/skill/munter-magic/ That said, you could still do it by extending your belay station. Here's how: Once you've finished constructing an anchor, clip your followers rope(s) through your master point. Lower yourself a certain amount to a comfortable belay spot, say 10 or more feet to a ledge / edge, or just hanging if needed. Belay from your harness like you normally would on the ground, using the strand(s) of rope that are now redirected through the anchor above you. Note: If there is a weight differential, you may want to anchor yourself down using a tree, slcd or other piece of gear, just like you would want to if belay at the ground. I have employed this system myself in certain scenarios, mostly topping out on blocky terrain, where you are slightly less worried about your second falling, but are concerned about lack of visibility or communications. As the probability of falling increases though, so should your inclination to belay directly from an anchor. > It simplifies things a lot should you have to do any self-rescue for your group.

The whole concept of short roping is not to catch a fall but to avoid a stumble escalating into a fall. As such short roping is a dangerous technique because only \"under ideal circumstances it is possible to hold a fall on a 30° slope\" (Source, unfortunately only in german: http://www.bergundsteigen.at/file.php/archiv/2008/2/print/54-61%20%28verbunden%20bis%20in%20den%20tod%29.pdf ) Therefore the use of short roping is heavily disputed due to high risk. The german alpine club completely discourages it while the swiss alpine club encourages the use mainly for psychological factors and being already tied into the rope when you reach a section that requires a proper belay again (instead of heaving the rope in your backpack and continue ropeless). Given this background, your fear is completely rational. There is a substatial amount of guided groups with too many (I have seen up to 4) guests at a short rope which also have a bad technique and are therefore very likely to stumble and fall. I would not join such a group. However, there is a difference between a guided tour (which intends to bring you on the mountain and back down again safely) and a course which is intended to teach you the necessary techniques to go mountaineering yourself. If there is a substantial amount of short roping in a course, it is no longer teaching. Moreover, most of the teaching does not require to go into terrain where short roping makes sense as it would then be too difficult. So this mainly boils down to find a good course. Before booking you can ask about short roping and also about all the other contents of the course. This will also help to align the course with your background.

       "    'body': 'My approach would depend on if I was confident that the rappel was straight forward with an obvious bottom with a solid secure place to become unsecured from the rope. If everything is straight forward, I would probably lower each person from the top and after everyone else is down rappel myself. Being lowered from the top is pretty similar to being lowered from the bottom, so the less experienced individuals should not have any problems. This lets you check that everyone is setup correctly before beginning to lower them. It also means you can monitor people near the edge and the rope as it goes over the edge. If the descent for the first person could be tricky or an anchor needs to be set up at the bottom, then it might be better if you go first. Instead of them tying in, I would probably have them each clip in to a large locking carabiner (maybe two that are opposite and opposed). The key thing to stress in this situation is for them to NOT drop the rope. If you have a bunch of people, this is really asking for the rope to get dropped. When setting up the anchor, for either method, you need to be aware of the edge. Putting the \"master point\" right at the edge decreases the chance it runs over anything sharp, but it also makes it more tricky to weight the rope. Putting the master point far from the edge makes weighting the rope easier.',\n",

       "    'body': 'I was always using and teaching the method, which Ben Crowell described very well in another answer, and it was standard in our club for a long time. However, over time it showed some important disadvantages. First, it doesn\\'t work reliably on slippery surface . When you \"sit down\", the force applied to your feet is high, and if one of them slips, you lose balance completely and usually hit the wall. And this hit may land on your controlling hand, so only the belay device (Prusik or something else which works without your help) will save you. I have had such and accident once and seen a lot more. The experience is quite nasty especially given that Prusik doesn\\'t catch instantly. Second, it\\'s quite hard to finish your \"sit down\" movement smoothly, usually there is a small fall in the end. At this moment, the rope hits the sharp corner with quite a force, so it can be damaged . Luckily, I haven\\'t seen the rope completely break off, but I\\'ve seen the sheath damaged as a result of such a move. And if you are in the real mountains using real anchors, they may fall off, being subject to a bump. So what should you do? Get to the edge, make sure your rope is under tension and hasn\\'t stuck anywhere. Make sure you are controlling the rope well with your controlling hand (below the rappelling device). Sit down on the edge, as you would do on the chair, your feet hanging down. Turn left (so your controlling right hand is far from the wall) and slowly squeese down until you are safely hanging on the rope, face to the wall. You can help yourself with you left (non-controlling) hand. NB: you controlling hand should always be on your rope during the operation, regardless of what is happening. If you are not sure, fix you rappelling device at a point, where you think you will be already hanging. By fixing I mean fixing in some way which works when you completely drop your hands. If you doesn\\'t know how to do this with your device, please get to know it. As a last resort, you can just tie a butterfly knot and clip to it with a carabiner.

This method is a poor one because the braking position would require the brake strand to go upward. But that's awkward and contrary to what people have in their muscle memory. (A workaround for this problem is to redirect the brake strand through a carabiner.) Auto-locking would be generally impossible with this device, at least as far as I know. While there might be ways of achieving that, I have not found any, and would strongly discourage any experimentation. Belaying via your body and e.g. dummy runners might be possible, but I haven't found any mention of this in the DAV (german alpine club) brochures that I've read so far, only some forum threads talking about it.

No sense in getting wet or risking anything if there is an easier, or proper crossing, a few hundred yards up or downstream. The other first step is to make sure you are all safe when you cross. Bring a strong rope that is long enough to span the river, or to at least span to a spot midway where you can take a break. A hundred foot rope strong enough for this purpose should be fine for most typical back country adventures. You can then tie the rope securely to the first person crossing, and hang on to that as a safety device in case the crosser wipes out and loses control. Learn the proper techniques for the ad-hoc harness. The rope also comes in very handy in hauling backpacks or other gear across the river. Once someone makes it across. If the river is not violent, and the danger of falling in is simply that you get wet, have to swim to the other side, then bushwhack through some dense mosquito infested brush to get back to the trail, then you should not use the rope. Use the rope where the danger of falling into the drink is very serious, e.g. a waterfall is not far ahead. As for where to cross, I disagree with Aaron's answer to target a deeper spot. Shallower is better*. Deeper being slower depends on the width of the stream being constant, which isn't always true. Additionally, the force you feel in a deeper section will be greater, and will be higher up on your body, making it more difficult for you to balance. If it's shallower, and you can see the bottom, you're pretty much in the clear as long as you don't rush yourself. When you cross, walk across, slowly and carefully. Contrary to Aaron's answer, don't swim across, walk. You can put your feet down. However, the dangers of getting a foot stuck, as he mentions, are very real and very serious. If you maintain your balance as you walk across, you will be fine. If you lose your balance, immediately pull your feet up, and position yourself flat on your back with your feet in front of you, up high. If the river is violent, your friends can haul you in using the rope. If the river is gentle but strong, then float down in the described position, and paddle yourself to one side or the other, and get out. There is no real technique as far as I am aware, just doggy paddle. Resist the temptation to try and put your feet down to stop you from floating downriver. If the river is deep and fast-moving enough to make this whole ordeal concerning, it is fast enough that if your foot gets stuck you will not be coming back up alive. Afterwards, collect all your gear, dry yourself off, and continue onward. *This answer based on the assumption that the river is not very deep, and where 'shallow' is not any deeper than waist height.\",\n",

Otherwise I'd go slow. When rappelling you usually lean back and push yourself away from the rock with your legs. When you're just above the overhang it helps getting back close to the rock, which reduces the force with which you're pushed against the rock and you can actually use your hands to get over the overhang.

Just because you have successfully rappeled there before, does not automatically mean you were/are qualified to do so. Very overhanging cliffs can\\'t be rappelled in the traditional sense. \" Bouncing ,\" like another answer here suggests, does not work on steep overhangs . You have to down-climb, and if that is too difficult, you have to down-aid . On multi-pitch rappel routes, it is not enough to know how to ascend the rope. You have to know how to actually climb back up! Aid climbing is a skill that takes years to develop, is very exhausting and takes a lot of time if you are a novice. Trust me, I have underestimated my aid-climbing skills before. For steep overhangs you will need to bring actual climbing gear (cams, nuts, aid-ladders, daisy chains, and possibly even hooks, pitons, copper heads or a bolt kit). If your route finding skills are lacking you can get yourself into serious trouble, even more so as if you had tried to climb the cliff. Make sure you know how to pendulum and tension traverse.

My advice is: Don\\'t do anything you can\\'t \"undo:\" If you rappel for several overhanging pitches and realize that the rappel anchor is missing, or that you are off route, you will have to climb back up, since you have pulled your ropes.

These were all seasoned climbers! Edit: I just reread your post: The height to rappel will be around 1800ft into 4 stages Regular climbing ropes are 200ft, which is the maximum distance you can rappel with two ropes.

I would then tie a shear lashing (see picture) on each leg. You want to try and use a significant length of the pole or possible even tie to lashings per pole to reduce the amount of twisting you get. However, using rope takes relatively long to setup and is relatively hard to do if you are not experienced, so I would probably use a different method. Another alternative would be to use bungee You would need 2 pieces of thinnish bungee per leg, probably no more than 20-30cm for your thickness of pole. Tie each bungee into a loop using a large knot such as a figure of eight, although a simple overhand knot would probably do. Then wrap the loop several times around the two poles until it is extended and reasonably tight. To tie it off just loop the remaining end of bungee through the knot in the other end. To make this more secure you can wrap knot under all the wrapping of bungee. You can also get hooks you can hook onto rather than looping through the knot which can be a bot unsecure if you're not careful. This is a very fast and easy way to attach the poles but is not the most secure and can slip a bit if left for a long time. Its also better suited to slightly thicker poles you may have difficulty getting the elastic tight enough on these poles. A third suggestion you be to use cable ties or jubilee clips . You would probably need two of these per leg. Cable ties are plastic, much lighter and easy to attach, but generally have to be cut off and so are one use only. Which may be an issue depending on how often you use the tripod. Also you need to dispose of the old clips sensibly, easily in an outdoors environment. Jubilee clips can be a bit of a pain to attach and generally require a screwdriver to tighten or remove. This could be an issue for outdoors use. My final suggestion would be to make a connector to attach the poles to the end of the the legs. From your picture I cannot tell but this would work best if the tent poles are not attached together, but it might work anyway. There are many ways you could make such a thing but my suggestion would be for each leg use a short piece of PVC pipe, just slightly larger internal diameter than the poles so that they can slide inside. Drill a hole right through the middle of the pipe and put a bolt through it. If you want to make it more secure and have the right tools you could but a threaded hole on each side and put a bolt in to act as a tighter. This method requires the most work beforehand but would probably result in very easy assembly in the field.\",\n",

Self: You could simply use the ends as an anchor and keep rappelling with another rope, or extend one side a short distance if you have the means. Partner: Your partner can transition to a lowering you on a single strand, giving you double the distance to the ground.

I now need to roll onto my front to push the head of the axe into the snow. But how do I do that without catching my crampons (as I roll). Does that make sense? When you're on your back, you don't need to get your crampons in the air. The front points are what would snag, and they're pointing at the sky. Even if you wanted to keep the heels of your crampons off the snow (which isn't necessary), you really couldn't, because your knees don't bend that way, and it's not practical to raise your legs at the hips in this situation. To roll, throw your weight to the side, as if you were rolling out of bed. The direction to roll is the one that heads the pick toward the snow like an arrow. Once you start rolling over, you can bend your knees to keep the front points of your crampons off the snow. All of this is theoretical and idealized. It's how you should practice it in order to get it in your muscle memory. But in reality it may not actually work out this way, and in a real self-arrest you may actually need to use your front points -- if that's what it takes to keep from going over a cliff, that's what you do.\",\n",

Although you are probably not likely to have this sort of thing while scrambling, if you know are going to need to clip in to something for some reason, you could always take a tip from caving and use dynamic rope to make up what we call \"cowstails\". These are used regularly in caving while abseiling and prusiking up ropes and on traverse lines to clip into as a safeguard in case of a slip or equipment failure. We use two at a time as it makes certain manouvres easier and safer but for your purpose just one would be better than a sling which absorbs no shock in the event of a fall. For example of a caver\\'s \"cowstails\": NOTE: It is possible to take a fall with a very large Fall Factor on Via Ferrata, which is why Via Ferrata \"lanyards\" have a means of allowing the rope to slip through some sort of fall protector (or have elasticated sections held together by stitching which will burst during a fall) in order to absorb the possible very large shock. The intention with cowstails is NOT to fall but to prevent a fall from happening. However if you do fall (and you should never climb above the item to which they are attached) it should only by with a small Fall Factor and onto dynamic rope. Cavers normally attach the costails to their harness using the Maillon Rapide which joins the two sides of the harness at the front and centre, by using the loop tied in the rope between the two karabiners in the picture above. A Maillon Rapide is used as it can take a 3-way directional loading safely, which an ordinary karabiner cannot, unless it is a specialised karabiner such as the Petz Omni whcih is designed to do this.',\n",

       "    'body': 'Just to be clear, what you are describing here is top-roping while belaying from above. Aside from doing it for the fun of it, or for the sake of gaining the experience of belaying from above, the only advantage I can see to top-roping with the belay up above is if you\\'re climbing a pitch where there is a lot of drag on the rope, and pulling one strand over the rocks is a lot easier than pulling two. EDIT: As Ben Crowell pointed out in the comments, top-roping a pitch that is longer than half the length of your rope would necessitate belaying from the top. Method 1 This would get really redundant really quick, and adds risk because it requires taking the climber off belay at the top of the climb. The climber would be required to clip into the anchor while you take them off belay and set up the new belay. That being said, I don\\'t think that autolocks are intended to be used for lowering, so this may be the preferred method if you wish to belay using the device in autolocking mode. Method 2 As you mention, this would be fatiguing. As I mentioned in my comment on your question–in answer to your question about the munter hitch backup: \"If something goes wrong, it seems that the rope would start whipping through the setup, and the belayer would have to rapidly grab the brake strand of the Munter and pull up, which would require a lot of dexterity, speed, and presence of mind.\" Their hand should never be off of the brake strand. In the set up in the BD video the rope would auto lock as soon as they let go of the release sling. They just say, \"use a back up,\" they show a munter back up, but don\\'t specify that\\'s what you have to use, you can back up however you want. They\\'re using a munter most likely because they\\'re quick and easy to tie. An autoblock would take time to set up, but you could throw a munter into your belay loop in just a second, one handed, and lower straight away. Method 3 This is a brilliant set up, it\\'s bomber and it\\'s redundant, but maybe a little too redundant for top-roping a single pitch. You\\'d still have to take the time to redirect the belay end of the rope through the top shelf of the anchor and tie your autoblock. ALTERNATE METHODS 2 ATC Method Attach the release sling to your harness as is demonstrated in method 3, but instead of using an autoblock, use another ATC on your harness. With this set up, you can quickly put the belay end of the rope into the ATC on your harness when the climber gets to the top, then put your weight on the sling to fully release the autolocker and then simply lower the climber from the ATC on your harness. Petzl Method I like Black Diamond\\'s method better, but Petzl demonstrates giving slack to the second by using a carabiner instead of a sling. This would be quicker than setting up the sling, and it may give you some leverage on the device which would make it a bit easier than yanking on a sling, but would still prove to be fatiguing on long or multiple lowers: My personal opinion: Method 3 is essentially just a more bomber way a of doing meathod 2. Either would be the preferred, safer methods of doing short lowers while multi pitching, but I don\\'t think either are intended to be used for top roping a group of people. Or doing long lowers in general. It\\'s my impression that lowering with an autolocking device is only supposed to facilitate giving the second some slack in the event they need it. I think it would be easier to top-rop belay from above the same as you would on the ground, except with the belayer closer to the anchor. Alternately, you could belay them straight off the ACT without going through the anchor as is demonstrated in this video . I suppose some other advantages to belaying top-ropers from above, other than the view, would be: if you didn\\'t want to be distracted by the other people on the ground taking to you; you wanted a different/better view of the climber; you wanted better communication with the climber when they got up higher; or you simply didn\\'t like one or more of the people on the ground and would prefer to avoid them.',\n",

It does however take some practice. Harness + Prusiks: If you want to do it safely , you should use some kind of harness. You can use a commercial climbing harness, or e.g. tie a swiss seat from webbing. Then for ascending the minimal version would be two cords about half to 3/4 the diameter of the rope you intend to climb, using the prusik hitch to attach them to the rope, and tying them to your harness. ( source ) At least one of them then should have a long enough part to make a foot loop. That way you can alternate by weighing your harness and weighing the foot loop, and shift the other prusik knot upwards, and you're safely connected to the rope itself. Another way is only connecting one prusik to your harness but still using the other one for your foot loops, known as Texan Prusik If you also want to do it efficiently, it might be worth investing in some more gear like carabiners, slings and mechancial ascenders, see e.g. Fixed line: Prusik vs mechanical ascender No gear #2: If there is enough rope, you could tie a simple harness in the end of the rope (e.g. again using the swiss seat, or the one-loop harness) but still leaving enough tail to tie it with a Blake hitch to the standing part of the rope (the part going upward to the anchor). This acts like the harness-prusik. Then instead of a foot prusik you could again use the russian wrap .\",\n",

Not only will water make the rock slick, but the prominence and the metal cables make people on the route prime targets for lighting strikes. You are going to want to wear grippy shoes because of the slick granite and gloves to protect your hands. What you are going to want to do to prevent a catastrophic fall is to clip yourself in to the cables. The minimum equipment for that is a rock climbing harness and a via ferrata setup. A rock climbing helmet would also be a good idea. The caribiners will need to be regular sized (not mini). As you go up the cables, you will have one caribiner connected to the cable at all times. When you get to a post, clip the other caribiner onto the cable on the other side of the post, before removing the first. Like this. If you were to fall, the caribiner would slide until it caught on the post. With that said, you DO NOT want to fall, because of the risk of hitting some one else and knocking them down, potentially causing them to fall. The odds are very few people are going to be clipped in. Also, there is traffic going up and down at the same time so be mindful for other people. Making certain that you water bottles are secured inside your pack so that they can't fall out and hid someone else is also a good idea.

       "    'body': \"Sicherungsmann Before they invented the first climbing aids, human anchors were all alpinists had for protection. This sounds exactly like something I would do. In fact, I've done it. When I was a kid I would rappel off of anything with anything, including the handrail of my grandparents deck, and I've actually been at the end of a rope with nothing but my father as an anchor while descending lower sloping alpine cliffs. Sure it's not safe, but people don't go rock climbing or rappelling because it's safe, they do it because it's fun. There's always inherent risk with descending ropes. The challenge is to mitigate those risks by assessing the danger, and taking proper precautions. First , you need to confirm the rail will hold your weight, easiest way to do this is to stand on it. If it'll hold your weight (which it will, because that's the whole intent of handrails...) , then it's strong enough to hang off with a rope. Better yet, get you and the friend you're putting on backup to stand on the rail, because if you're putting the rope over it, then it's not holding just your weight, it's holding his too. A little bounce test will confirm it'll hold. Second , tie your anchor as close to the bolts as you can. Shear strength is much greater than pull-out strength, if you tie your rope in the middle of the rail, then it's much like tying a two point anchor with too great an angle, you're actually going to put more force on the anchors than you would by hanging off only one side. If it were to buckle in the middle, it could pull the screws out. I think I recommend a clove hitch, because it won't slip to the side, otherwise I'd probably recommend a bowline on a bight backed up with a carabiner for ease and convenience of tying, the tail of the rope behind your knot is going to go back to your human anchor. Third , tie in your sicherungsmann (belayer/security man) . You could get him to hold you on a locked off hip belay , but since he's just acting as deadman anchor , you could just have him tie the other end of the rope around his middle and get him in a bomber stance, keeping the direction of pull in mind; if he's sitting on the ground with his feet propped up against a door frame or whatever and you take a fall, then the force is going to want to pull his butt off the ground because the railing will be higher than he is, and if he goes over then you're both in trouble. He needs to get his feet high enough so that if the rope goes tight, he's going to be properly braced for it. That's my answer to your question as you've scoped it, now I'm going to offer some suggestions: A better anchor would be to use your couch as a deadman anchor . Your couch is not going to go through your patio door if you turn it sideways and tie your rope around the middle. Don't put the rope over the hand rail, run it under the bottom of the railing over the edge of the floor of your patio, the floor is stronger, and it removes any possible extension from your system. It does make getting over the rail and onto your rope a little trickier; you have to reach over the rail and grab the rope from the other side, tie into it, climb over the rail, squat down, take the slack through your descender, and then lower yourself over the edge, but it's more secure. Be cautious on your first few goes. Don't dive over the rail, don't go fast, and don't try to stop fast. Slowing yourself down puts more force on the rope than just body weight. When you get close enough to the ground that a fall won't hurt, then you can fart around and swing and bounce on the rope to see how strong it is. As long as you cover all your angles, you can have fun doing silly stuff with minimal gear.\",\n",

       "    'body': 'The Ethic So, the ethic among experienced climbers is to not toprope on the base of a popular multipitch route. In addition to the safety issues you point out, its just not fair to the people who invested the time to learn to lead. Especially not a destination place like Yosemite Valley where people may have traveled a long way to get there. You say this was a long single pitch route, so maybe its a grey area. But a large group of beginners would still be better served by going to a smaller cliff that was more setup for group toproping. Saftey issues I did this once when a partner and I (not a group, just the 2 of us) wanted to toprope a very hard route that shared an anchor with a moderate route we\\'d just lead, and it had the exact disadvantages you mention (basically point-for-point, you identified them correctly). The biggest are: The knot / rope can get stuck in a crack. If that happened, you\\'d have to perform a rescue, which would require (if nothing else) a 2nd rope and a pair of very experienced climbers. If there\\'s only one experience leader, and he/she is the one belaying, you\\'re basically going to have to go for help. (sounds theoretical, but it happened to me personally once with a regular toprope, and a knot only makes it more likely). Because there\\'s a big knot at the mid point of the line,the belayer has to \"pass the knot\", which can be done safely, but is quite tricky, requires experience with rescue techniques, and communication with the climber. Too complicated for toproping! The rope-stretch becomes long and nearly unpredictable at that point. With the full length of a 60m rope, you\\'ll get about 15\\' of rope stretch, the first 5\\' of which is almost a freefall. I personally don\\'t like to belay a beginner on the full length of a 60m rope, and the system you propose is more than twice that long. You have to remember that beginners don\\'t know how to fall yet, and might do any kind of crazy thing during the fall, getting hurt where an experience climber wouldn\\'t. And even if they didn\\'t get hurt, the rope stretch could really freak them out. To compensate for the rope-stretch, the belayer has to put a huge amount of tension on the line, almost sitting his / her full weight on it. That\\'s going to mess up the climber\\'s balance some, too. Frustrating for everybody. The leader\\'s responsibility When you take beginners out, you (as the experienced climber) have to be responsible for all aspects of their experience, both keeping them safe, and trying to keep them from getting freaked out. Its actually a lot of responsibility. And when you have then bouncing around on a 140m line, 200\\' off the ground with up to 30\\' of ropestretch, you just can\\'t do that. :) Where to look for more information AMGA offers a \"Single Pitch Instructor\" course which focuses on toprope site management. Its only available as a multiday course, and their info isn\\'t available for free online. The annual issues of \"Accidents in North American Mountaineering\", published by the American Club, here , are a good to read, but they only include accidents that were reported to the park service, usually ones that required a rescue. Minor accidents, or accidents where the climbers could rescue themselves, may not make the report. All rope manufacturers publish elongation statistics, as one of the metrics the UIAA requires them to test. These vary between ropes.',\n",

       "    'body': \"This is a very complicated topic, and you can take an entire course where you learn and practice the techniques. Reading an answer on SE is not going to be enough. You need to practice. The following is just an outline. There is an entire chapter in Freedom of the Hills on glacier travel and crevasse rescue. The first step is always going to be to construct an anchor so that the team can get out of arrest position. If the leader is the one who's fallen in, then the person at the opposite end of the rope would normally be the one who gets up and builds an anchor, while other team member(s) stay in arrest position. You build the anchor between the lip of the crevasse and the nearest person, so that everyone has tension released from the rope and can stand up. While doing this, you want to make sure not to create more victims, so e.g., the person building the anchor needs to be on a Prusik. Now talk to the climber and discuss the situation. You want to know if they're hurt. If possible, you can try to prepare the lip of the crevasse so that the rope doesn't become entrenched. For example you can see if you can get an ice ax or a pack under it. This will be easier if the victim is able to get to a stance and unweight the rope. In most cases, it is not possible to keep the climbing rope from becoming completely entrenched. If you have enough extra line, you may want to prepare a separate portion of the lip and throw down a separate rescue line. After this, you do not immediately start hauling the victim out. That's a last resort, and often it doesn't work. The following are various options to consider, roughly in order. See if the victim can climb out under their own power, while belayed from above. There may be an easy way to walk out of the crevasse at the bottom. If so, then you could lower the victim. If the victim isn't hurt, he should be able to Prusik up the rope. Getting over the lip may be physically difficult, especially if the rope is entrenched. It may be helpful if there are two ice tools that the victim can use. As a last resort, such as in situations where the victim is unconscious or so badly injured that he can't Prusik up, consider trying to set up a pulley system and hauling him out. This may or may not work. If the rope is entrenched, you can't just haul the victim over the lip -- people have been killed that way.\",\n",

A more normal setup based on standard mountaineering practices would use a seat harness, and in addition the would be some provision for allowing the climbers to pass the bolts while staying protected. As far as I can tell from the photo, the guy in the red shirt is going to have to unclip his (non-locking?) carabiner, then clip it onto the next section of cable. While it's unclipped, he has no protection. But I don't know if any of this matters, because they're walking on horizontal wooden boardwalks, and they have the cables or chains to hold onto with their hands. I wouldn't really feel any need for a belay in this situation, so it might not matter much if the protection is not reliable or mainly psychological. How safe is a chest harness when used without a sit harness? This is really a whole separate issue that doesn't apply to the situation being described, where the belay is unnecessary. For real climbing, you use a seat harness because you need more than a psychological belay.\",\n",

       "    'body': 'If you have some credible people saying not to be roped up, I\\'d love to see it, because that sounds completely insane to me. Here\\'s why: If you are traveling on a glacier without being roped up, there is a very, very, very good chance that you will die if you fall in a crevasse. This isn\\'t because you vanish into nowhere, but because you will get what we morbidly call \"corked\" - you will get squished between the two sides and get stuck, most likely sustaining massive injuries on the way. To compound the issue, a rescue in this case can be nearly impossible to an average group for several reasons. First, access to a person\\'s harness or other attachment points will be limited. Second, if you are so far down as to be stuck, rope length becomes a serious potential issue. Third, close contact with ice for a long period is a major hypothermia risk. Good training, practice, and technique makes the risk of dragging in partners very low, and the potential gain of being able to rescue someone very high. Keeping a good number of people on a team is also helpful (two people is an obvious minimum, but three or four is better if you have them). I suppose I can imagine situations where a very poorly prepared group wouldn\\'t rope up, but that should be avoided from the very beginning. This isn\\'t to say that it doesn\\'t happen. A very good friend of mine, Jim Davidson, recently wrote a book about his experience on Rainier, where he fell into a crevasse, dragging his partner with him. His partner and dear friend, Mike Price, died in the accident, and Jim managed to climb his way out by the skin of his teeth (the book is called The Ledge ). So what this boils down to is that yes, as a rope team you risk accidents that involve more than just the first person to fall. Those risks can be minimized and managed carefully, but they never go away entirely. Training, experience, practice, and good equipment are all necessary to avoid those situations.',\n",

As you point out correctly, a surface rescue is impossible if you have knots in the rope, since the rope is under tension and you cannot untie the knots. However, you can also drop a different strand of rope down to the victim and haul them out with that (it's then called a rescue strand). Since it's not under tension, it's possible to remove all knots from the rope before sending it down. Some examples are a 2:1 (C-pulley or drop loop) haul or a 6:1 (C cross Z) haul, where in both cases you drop a bight of rope down to the victim. They attach the rope (with a pulley) to their harness, and then the rescuers haul. You could also send down a single strand of rope down and do a 3:1. In any case, for a surface rescue, you need some rope available on the surface. All climbers tied together on a glacier should have some additional rope to perform a rescue. Do note that all these require the victim to be conscious and able to help. If this is not the case, a rescuer needs to rappel into the crevasse, potentially address any immediate life-threatening injuries, clip the rope to the victim, ascend back out, then haul. This gets quite complicated, but is part of the guides' exam. The last option would be for the victim to self-rescue, passing their prussiks over each knot in the rope. Clipping into the knots is possible and makes life a little bit easier.\",\n",

Another problem is that the single strand of rope is likely to hurt the person wearing it if they take a fall. The more standard, safe procedure in this situation would be to use a bowline on a coil. I believe that's what people did before swami harnesses and seat harnesses. However, it's not the best thing if someone's going to take a hard fall; it can injure or asphyxiate them.

       "    'body': \"This answer is purely complementary and does not attempt to answer the question directly. Another option for securing a rappel is the fireman's belay . This works on single pitch climbs when someone is at the base of the cliff, or on multi-pitch routs when someone is already at the next, lower anchor. The belayer takes a hold of both strands of the rope, while keeping in mind to give the abseiling person enough slack to smoothly feed rope through the rappel device. In case of an emergency, the belayer pulls the rope strands tight, which causes the belay device to lock up. I use this method whenever possible, since it is much quicker than attaching and detaching a prussic. It also eliminates the difficulty of resuming a rappel after the prussic has bitten down on the rope. In case of an emergency, the person below could safely lower the person rappelling, which is not possible with a self-belayed-abseil. These points make the firemen's belay the preferred method when helping a novice to rappel. Someone new to ropes, harnesses, and rappel devices can concentrate on the more immediate aspects (avoiding overhangs and jerky movements,) while the belayer takes care of the unexpected, and can take an active roll in lowering, if necessary. Some people swear by never even using a prussic, and instead lowering the first person off of the anchor, and then using the fireman's belay for the second. This methodology should only be used when lowering off of one's own gear, since the weight of the climber and the friction of the rope quickly abrades fixed rappel rings. Benefits are: It becomes impossible to rappel off of the end of the ropes when the backup knots were forgotten (just watch out for not lowering the climber off of the end of the rope,) and if it turns out that the rope is not long enough for a double-roped rappel, the climber can climb back up on top-rope, instead of having to awkwardly climb on self-belay. I have also heard that this method can be quicker than using prussics, although I don't have any data to substantiate this claim. Drawbacks are: When rappeling the traditional way, it is possible to extend the second's belay device with a sling, which makes it possible for both climbers to set up for rappel and check each other's work. Since this is not possible when lowering a climber first, that method should be used for experts only, since a novice should never set up an abseil without having his/her work checked (no-one really should.)\",\n",

I have gotten my ATC stuck more times than I\\'d like to admit. ATCs don\\'t just like to eat poorly assembled autoblock loops, they also like to eat loose clothing, and long hair (ouch!). So here I go: If you are rappelling on a slab, a jammed ATC is often not that big of a deal. You can brace yourself against the slab and, while you are \"walking up the wall,\" you pull yourself up with one hand, whilst taking in slack with your break hand: voila, your ATC is unjammed. This of course is not possible if you are hanging in mid-air, unless you are able to do one-armed pull-ups on a 9mm \"string.\" In this scenario it is nice to have a cordelette with you.

Typically you don't spend a lot of time roped up when canyoning (not at the grades that I've done it anyway). It's more a kin to scrambling than climbing where you may use a rope in particularly exposed areas or where there is deep water. Water rescue (How do you stop someone from being swept down stream but also not drown them by applying to much pressure to the rope? You need to guide people into the side of the river not pull them as hard as you can) Choosing the right river, are there dangerous undercurrents? how big do the rapids get? Sliding, you will often slide down slick river beds, route choice is essential here, see above Jumping into deep water. You will often have to choose whether to jump into a splash pool or rappel down. Obviously this depends on the depth of the water and the currents, etc. You may or may not need a harness. This is somewhat dependant on grade, etc. I've been a few times and never used one. Harnesses (in some circumstances) can be a problem, particuarly when someone is being pulled on a rope in fast water. So a rope is often used as a loop of rope, secured around the participant, a single figure of eight is added to prevent it constricting too much. This technique is preferred as it allows the rope to ride up to the persons shoulders, therefore holding them above the water. If it was attached at waist height it would be easy to tip the person upside down in the water. The addition of a chest strap prevents this. Where is it acceptable to do this. As mentioned in my answer in the previous question . This sport can have damaging environmental impacts .

       "    'body': \"In addition to Felix's excellent answer of what should be done it practice, it is well worth knowing how to pass a knot in the rope (whether while rappelling or hauling). This will generally be more time consuming than just having an extra length of rope for which to affect the rescue and it should be noted that the knots that were tied to add friction on the lip of the crevasse during the fall will also add friction during the haul back out, perhaps becoming completely jammed up on the lip. As this is a standard self-rescue technique, I'll give a brief overview of how this might look for a typical 3:1 z-drag setup. The additional gear requirements are minimal, needing only an extra sling/prusik and two carabiners. Always obtain professional instruction Rig the z-drag as normal, but with one key difference: attach the braking prusik to the anchor with a load-releasable knot , e.g., a Munter-Mule hitch . Haul as normal until the knot in the rope gets close to the anchor. Clip a backup knot, untie the hauling prusik and retie it on the other side of the knot in the rope. Haul until the knot in the rope is jammed up against the braking prusik. Use the extra sling to tie another prusik onto the hauling line below the knot to act as the new braking prusik and clip into the anchor (if there will be more knots to pass, make sure to use another Munter-Mule). Slide this prusik as far as possible down the rope. Making sure a backup knot is tied, slowly release the Munter-Mule on the original braking prusik until the load is safely taken up by the newly tied prusik. Remove the original prusik from the system completely. Haul another foot or so until the knot in the rope is up against the pulley or carabiner at the anchor. Either untie the knot (generally difficult, but simpler) or slightly extend the attachment point so that the pulley/carabiner can be reattached below the knot in the rope. Repeat this process until the fallen climber is safe. For variation on this approach, see the following technical bulletin from Petzl: Crevasse Hauling on a Rope with Knots . While illustrated with a Micro-traxion and a tibloc, the same procedure works with prusiks as well. It proceeds much in the same manner for steps 1 and 2, but then uses an extra sling to connect the hauling prusik to the anchor (shown in green): Pull on the hauling system to release tension on the braking mechanism (whether micro-traxion or prusik), and then allow the rope to slide back through the system until the weight of the climber is taken up by the green sling. With this newly introduced slack, untie the knot (or pass it by extending the pulley at the anchor), then haul again until the green sling is slack and can be removed.\",\n",

You would have the weight of a harness and a carabiner for a munter hitch (probably 200-250 grams plus the rope). It is possible to rappel from accessory cord but this is likely out of specification. If there is no fixed gear to rappel from it may be possible to thread an hourglass with a sling or accessory cord. This may be easy on some types of rock and basically impossible on others such as downward oriented compact limestone. As a basic guideline you should always adhere to the good old Paul Preuss Das Maß der Schwierigkeiten, die ein Kletterer im Abstieg mit Sicherheit zu überwinden im Stande ist und sich auch mit ruhigem Gewissen zutraut, muss die oberste Grenze dessen darstellen, was er im Aufstieg begeht. (The difficulty a climber can comfortably overcome on the descent must be the limit of what he is climbing on the ascent) On the way up assess the difficulties and turn around if you think it is too dangerous. Especially when you are alone. While scambling alone is a great joy as the flow is never interrupted, one has always to keep in mind that being alone greatly limits the possibility to belay if it should become necessary. (And adding the requirement of being lightweight just complicates this further more.) And always keep in mind that nobody might be noticing a fall and call the rescue if you are alone',\n",

If the Prusik is downhill from the ATC, then the Prusik only ever has to supply enough force to brake you on the brake strand. This is much, much less than your body weight, which is what you\\'d need if you had it above the ATC. An even more important reason why it\\'s a terrible idea to put the Prusik above the ATC is that it has a really terrible mode of failure that can kill you. It goes like this. You have your left hand above the ATC, tending the Prusik, while your right hand is on the brake strand below. Something happens (rockfall, getting banged around, ...) and your right hand goes off the brake strand. In this panic situation, you grip with your left hand as tight as you can to try to save yourself. This has the effect of preventing the correct tension in the Prusik, so the Prusik doesn\\'t function. The rope strips the flesh off the palm of your left hand, and you fall to your death. Make sure to add an extension between your belay loop and your belay device, so that the Prusik can\\'t possibly get pulled up into the ATC. Clip it to the belay loop or the leg loop or to a loop of my personal anchor system (PAS)? For many harnesses, as long as you have the Prusik downhill from the ATC, it doesn\\'t matter. The Prusik only has to supply braking force, and a leg loop, for example, is plenty strong enough for this. However, for some harnesses the force on the biner can pull the leg loop open. Therefore it may be safer to make a habit of clipping it in to somewhere more secure.',\n",

You fix the ATC guide to your harness in guide mode, so that you can easily pull in the rope, but it blocks when you load it (i.e. sit in your harness hands-free). Then, you add a long loop of cord or webbing above the device with a friction knot such as a klemheist (probably preferred to a prusik since this knot is easier to slide up). You then repeat two steps until you reach your destination: In one motion, you pull yourself up on the rope above the friction knot with one hand, push yourself up with your foot in the loop and pull the slack through the device with the other hand. Sit in your harness (possible because the device auto-blocks) and slide the friction knot upwards. Repeat until you reach the top of the rope. The important trick is to do the first step in one single motion. Otherwise, you\\'ll waste quite a bit of energy trying to pull the rope through the device while standing still in the loop of cord. In the following image, I drew the setup and marked where to push/pull/slide in which step: If you have a situation where the rope is not fixed on top of the climb and two strands go down, you obviously have to feed both strands through the device and the prusik. Conversely, if the rope is fixed , you could also use a GriGri instead of the ATC Guide. As usual, a prusik backup below the device is recommended. An additional note from recent experience: Don\\'t do this with thick(ish) ropes. While it works really well with newer single ropes (9.x mm) or half ropes, older/thicker/\"plushy\" single single ropes make this technique really hard or impossible.

The second thread gets a bit off course, but also has some good info from \"momoface\" and a couple others. If your friend has partial use of his other arm (e.g. a stump), he may find he\\'s able to incorporate it into his technique. Top-rope belaying: Either a GriGri or ATC should work. My instinct would be to redirect the brake strand through a second carabiner (e.g. off a leg loop) to make it safer when lowering. One of the climbers in the above threads is able to use his stump to operate the lever, but I think with a redirected brake line it should be possible to use the brake hand to operate it. When taking in slack, locking off the rope and squatting should be sufficient to pull in slack if there\\'s too much friction in the system. The slack can then be pulled through the device as the belayer stands back up. Lead belaying: I would expect a GriGri to be rather difficult to use, as paying out slack one-handed would be rather finicky. A traditional device like an ATC would be quite straightforward. Other issues: You may find difficulties with climbing gyms as they will have standardized belay techniques they expect you to use, and those may require both hands. Your friend would essentially be using a lead-style technique when taking in slack for top-roping, rather than the near-universal PBUS style of using the other hand to lock off the rope. Often gyms require additional training or testing for lead climbing, but that might be one way to work within their existing framework. In the US you may be able to use the ADA as leverage, particularly if your friend has been well-trained and you get supporting documentation from a place with expertise in this area (e.g. Paradox).

Therefore, I think this is a question of confidence . Cars are among the biggest killers, but we do not generally wear protective equipment when crossing the street. We know that if we are careful, the danger it tolerable and not worth putting on knee pads and spine support. But a drunk man, or a reckless kid, at the middle of the street, are in danger. As a child I have climbed up to about 10 meters up trees - for fun and to shake down walnuts.

So, as with other dangerous sports, I would advise not to overcome one\\'s fear . If you are afraid of doing something - then maybe it is objectively dangerous.

A hip belay can be incredibly fast and is a common technique in situations where falls are unlikely. Many/most gyms do not allow you to hip belay, but many of those gyms also do not allow you to speed climb. Outdoors you can obviously do whatever you want. Another alternative is to progressively walk/run further away from the wall/cliff. For lead climbing this is dangerous because the fall will pull you back towards the cliff face and there is a high likelihood of you losing control of the rope. For top roping the angle of pull is different and the forces are reduced. For climbs where there is no risk of hitting an obstacle/ledge on the way down (i.e., a climb that is well suited for speed climbing) this can be a reasonably option.

Basic requirement As with any rappel problem a basic requirement is to have enough friction in the system, and preferably a way to go hands-free. As always this should be tested and not simply assumed. I don\\'t think that anyone can tell you exactly what will produce the proper amount of friction without further qualification (rope, rope age, body weight, length of rappel, etc.) Remember that the control will be less at the bottom of the rope as you will not have the weight of the hanging rope assisting in braking. Though a wet rope is quantitatively weaker its strength returns to normal when it is thoroughly dried, therefore you should be able to test whatever system you choose without significant expense. Generating friction It will help to have an understanding of friction in rope systems. Here is a good reference: The Mechanics of Friction in Rope Rescue -- Stephen W. Attaway, Ph.D. Ways to add friction to your rappel system: If you are using a rappel rack add more bars. Create a redirect that adds a bend or two to the rope. Extend the rappel device and pass the brake end through a second device or Munter hitch. Use a Double Munter hitch . This provides a great deal of friction, is always at hand (assuming you have an HMS \\'biner) and does not twist the rope in the way that a simple Munter does. It should be excellent as an \"oh sh*t\" slippery-rappel method. (But as always you must test it yourself.) With any of these methods you can add a Prusik backup below the device(s). While there is less friction when wet these hitches still work according to testing . Once again you must make sure your particular cord and rope work together. Additional resources As far as a source of information consider that cavers and canyoneers routinely rappel on wet rope, though usually not dynamic climbing rope . These people can likely provide good instruction though they may use equipment you are unfamiliar with.',\n",

The awkwardness isn't the most important issue in and of itself, but you want to avoid a situation in which the start is so messy that you get banged around, it causes you to lose your grip on your brake hand, and you fall to your death. To prevent this, you can use a Prusik backup below the rappelling device; Freedom of the Hills has a description of how to do this on p. 198. (Other methods include a fireman's belay if you're not the first off, or being lowered if you're not the last off.) Anyway, in terms of the sheer awkwardness of the start, you can try to compensate by putting your feet far apart and bending your knees as much as possible. When I use the Prusik backup, I extend my rappelling device (ATC) so that the Prusik can't get caught in the ATC. This means that I normally have both hands below the ATC, on the brake strand. However, you can always take the left hand off of the brake strand if you think the use of that hand would help you to get over the edge. Ryley raises a good point in a comment, which is that the extension actually forces you to get lower on the ledge before you can weight the rope. This is one reason that the system I prefer is slightly different from the one shown in figure 11-13 on p. 198 of FotH (8th ed). Rather than extending my ATC by a large amount (maybe 25 cm in their figure), I only extend it by about 10 cm, and I clip the Prusik into a leg loop. Because the Prusik is on the brake strand, it only needs to supply a small amount of force, so IMO attaching it to the leg loop is no less safe than attaching it to the belay loop. Using the leg loop allows the extension to be much shorter.\",\n",

Once the hands have met, the you pinch the ropes together with your left thumb and slide the right hand down the braking strand. Then you lock off by moving the right hand off to the side to be ready to catch. What is dangerous about this method? The dangerous part of this method come from having the braking hand in front of the braking plane. What is the braking plane? Basically, there is a line that goes straight across the belay device where friction only occurs if the braking strand is held behind it. This has basically no friction. This is ready to catch. Here is a zoomed out view of what it looks like. Anytime your brake hand is in front of the braking plane, you are not able to hold a fall without moving it behind the braking plane. While pulling in slack with this method, your brake hand will be in front of the braking plane. Usually, it happens fast enough that it is not a problem, but sometimes people fail to lock off and leave their hand in front of the braking plane. At that point it would be more than reasonable to yell at them and tell them to get it together. Sometimes this method does make more sense, and in that case the solution is to use a muntor hitch. A muntor hitch does not suffer from the braking plane problem, and in fact generates the most friction when the rope strands are parralel.',\n",

A typical installation one only one end of the rope is given on the figure below. The big advandage of installing a rappel like this is that when someone gets stuck in the middle of the descent, you can still lower them from above without the need of special techniques. On the figure you see that the eight blocks the rope from going trough the two anchor-points. So the rapelling is done on the left end of the rope.

And even more important, identify points where it is good and safe to change between both. In the end, you should come up with a plan like rope up at the start of the ridge; climb roped for 10 pitches; then there's about 200m of steep grassy/rocky terrain to be scrambled; rope up again at a small plateau about ten meters below the start of the vertical crack... The general rule (unless one of the team is a trained mountain guide which learn some techniques for such cases) is that whenever you rope up the team members, you have to install some protection, otherwise a fall of one member will pull down the whole group. A second rule of thumb is that you better go some extra meters roped than having to do all the preparation stuff somewhere in steep terrain where you already are halfway into climbing and suddenly have to find a place to stand, build an anchor, and untangle your rope while you just have one hand free as you need the other to prevent a fall. The drawback of that rule is that for the leader it can be somewhat awkward to leave the steep climbing terrain into some more scrambling like terrain and finally don't find a spot to place a solid anchor to belay their second. This requires some experience to see such situations as they appear and is also the reason why it isn't quite easy to train such skills somewhere at home at a single-pitch route that you know by heart. The best training option I could imagine here would be to scramble into some unknown mixed terrain and try to figure out the places where you would start to rope up. Technical skills You did also mention that all the roping and unroping takes you quite long. You can try to add some technical training here, i.e. in terms of rope handling and organization, which can also be done at home. This includes for example unroping only as much as necessary: The team members should wear their harness and the stuff rigged there at least as long as there are still climbing passages to be done If the passage to go unroped is rather short, untie the rope only from one team member but let is tied to the harness of the other one and either have the rope wrapped up as ring-shaped package around their neck (cf. image below) or in their backpack.

To keep naming clear, I am going to refer to PBUS and european method. Here we have a discussion about another \"phase\" of belaying as being unsafe (hand up while pulling in slack). ShemSeger already puts the hole thing nicely into perspective, so I will only try to convince you, that it is even equally safe: As any (sane) belaying method, the main principle is to never let go of the braking strand. Now if you take that strictly, you could say loosening, but not removing, your hand from the braking strand equals letting go - but I would refute that, due to the second principle of the european method: Use the non-breaking hand as \"sensor\". In the phase where you slide your hand on the braking strand upwards, your other hand is holding the rope above the belay device. In case of a fall in that exact moment, you feel it there, giving you ample time to close your hand behind the belay device. I consider this even advantageous, as it facilitates dynamic belaying. You grip the rope before the device, building up tension in the rope and preparing yourself for the harder pull. Then you can let some rope through the belay device in a controlled fashion. Mind you, I am not saying PBUS is bad. I can\\'t, I have never done it. I am just making a case for a method which is widely and successfully used and at least according to the OP, is accused of being unsafe.',\n",

There are various pros and cons on holding the rope when you fall (the main problem being grabbing the wrong rope and getting your fingers crushed) but most climbers agree that in the event of a fall grabbing the rope immediately in front of your waist point gives you a safe point (which also keeps your hands away from gear.) If you are deep under an overhang and your hands slip you could drop head down, but that would be a rare case - and hopefully your belay point will keep you away from hitting the wall head down anyway.

Then you can pull hard and straight away from your hips while thrusting your hips backwards, which pulls in a solid 4+ ft of rope at once. Then, you reset your hips and slide your top hand back up to the belay device, then follow with the other. A cycle takes about half a second, and is very intuitive once you've done it a couple times. This technique allows you to take in a lot of slack without bringing your brake hand over the belay device. It does look kinda goofy, but it's better to look foolish than drop your partner. I should also add, this is a little awkward to do at first, especially on lead. Without your top hand, the belay device will want to drop down and hang at groin level unless the load side is already taut. This makes it kinda weird to pull slack, especially during the reset section. It's not super difficult to do but it's worth yarding out some rope with both climbers on the ground to practice.\",\n",

With that said, however, I have had my share of getting caught climbing in a thunderstorm, and have since tried to do some reading on the subject. The biggest hurdle to surmount here is that most lightning safety advice revolves around seeking shelter, which is often not a viable option midway up a multipitch route. Here are some points worth considering: the magnitude of both voltage and current in a lightning strike is absolutely massive, and at those levels anything can conduct electricity (albeit only to a certain distance). you are exposed to three main mechanisms of electricity-based injury by lightning: direct strike closing a circuit bridging a gap for the current to jump through on its route towards the point of lowest potential (generally a lower point in the ground). you are also exposed to mechanical and thermal danger such as shrapnel debris due to explosive impacts and fires. The rough points, as I understand them, are as follows: lightning is likely to strike the highest, sharpest point from there on, it will travel on the surface in all directions. Sharper edges will therefore pose the highest risk (the magnitude dissipates faster over flat surfaces and the current quickly loses energy and can no longer \"jump\" through the air) therefore, ridges, buttresses, and crack systems are the next most dangerous place to be near, and you should seek to get away from them standing under roofs, arches, or cave entrances increases the likelihood the current will pass through you if it jumps from the roof to the ground, so stay away from them wet rope is an excellent conductor and can cover a large area, increasing your risk of electrocution from an impact, you should seek to spool it up as soon as possible. Also consider this when rappelling,. a nearby strike may involve a concussive force, so it\\'s important to remain secured to prevent a fatal fall recall: the rock will be conducting, so you should seek to minimize the surface area of the the shape formed by all points of contact between your body and the ground or wall (see page 3 in the NOLS article for an explanation of minimizing the potential difference your body offers to the \"circuit\") metal and electronics are not likely to attract lightning strikes (unless pointy and protruding), but they will definitely lead to heat burns, so you should seek to remove them from your body (carabiners, cell phones, etc.). thunder storms are more common in the summer months in the afternoons however, mountains have their own weather systems, so you should always be aware of your local weather the entire time you\\'re out there.

       "    'body': 'I was always taught three very important things to consider before you even attempt to rescue someone in distress in the water. You, yourself, all alone, barely float. You might think you\\'re awesome at back floating, but put just a ten pound weight on your chest and see if you can still float. A person will weigh more than that. People in distress in the water are stupid, scared, and lethal. They will grab on to ANYTHING to stay afloat. That includes you. They will have no problem drowning your ass to save themselves. For you, you\\'re making decisions in a crisis; for them, they\\'re in survival-at-all-costs mode. Whatever caused the problem for that person could still cause a problem for you. If they got tangled in a rope, then what\\'s gonna stop you from getting tangled? Sometimes this is a non-issue, but most of the time people that are in distress in the water get that way by accident. A strong current, a big wave, an animal, all of which you will have to deal with too, if you decide to go out there. So if someone is in distress, your goal is not to get them out of the water. Your goal is to keep them alive long enough for two or three people to get them out of the water. I was taught: Reach - From the pool side, or dock or boat or platform, grab a stick and reach. If they can reach out to the stick, you may be able to get them to the edge. Don\\'t be afraid to \"beat\" them with the stick. If they can clearly reach it and are just not seeing it, smack them with it. Especially their arms and hands. You\\'re not trying to knock them out, you\\'re trying to get them to notice the stick. Hitting their arms or hands will get them to instinctively notice. Again don\\'t knock them out; think nun with a ruler not He-Man and the Masters of the Universe. Throw - If the stick won\\'t reach, or they don\\'t notice it, time to start throwing things. Take anything that floats, even a little and whip it right at their head. Not in front, not behind, not off to the side, right smack at their head. The goal is that while they are flapping around like a fool, their hands or arms land on the floaty thing. Usually \"life savers\" or other pool floats work really well. Don\\'t throw anything that is going to cause a concussion, you are aiming for their head. So even though it floats the 4x4 post, not a good choice. If you don\\'t have anything else, then chuck it at them, but avoid the head obviously. However consider that it will be further away and probably useless because of that. Walk - IF you can stand up AND you know there are no issues (like rocks or animals) then it\\'s generally safe enough to walk out to them and carry/push them to the edge. Again, this is more like in a pool setting. If you don\\'t know the bottom, or the cause for distress, you\\'re better off skipping this one. If you just have to, then use a walking stick, carry two \"floats\" (ones on a rope work well), stay calm and \"poke-and-step\" your way out to them. If you can no longer reach the bottom with sure footing when you get to them this isn\\'t going to work. But hey your closer now, so try beaning them with the floats. Touch - This is totally a last resort. If you have to go and get them by walking or swimming to them, then use the floats. Especially as you get close. Your goal isn\\'t to get them to land. Not alone. Your goal is to keep their head above water. You need to be really prepared for this and it shouldn\\'t be tried except when there are no other options. Get to them. Try to come up behind them. Grab them by the neck, forcefully. Put your arm around their neck. You\\'re not trying to choke them, you\\'re trying to make sure they can\\'t turn around and drown you. If you have to, be prepared to smack/punch this person. Sometimes they will need that shock to stop acting a fool. Sometimes you will need to to keep yourself out of trouble. Approach this option as a fight, not a rescue. Get to them, take control, dominate, then once they\\'re calm (or knocked out), focus on treading water and keeping your head, and theirs above the water. Only then do you try to drag them to the shore. In short, if you have to go this route (and you really shouldn\\'t) 1. Subdue, 2. Stabilize, 3. Exit. The real problem with this approach is that you are not rescuing a person making decisions, you\\'re rescuing a mass that will do anything, including kill you, to stay alive. You might as well think of your friend your trying to save as a mass of wet loins. You really have to approach it with that mind set, and be ready to do what ever it takes to keep your self alive, even if it means punching your friend in the face till they are dazed so they don\\'t drown you too. You approach from the back and use the \"choke hold\" (don\\'t choke them that won\\'t help) to minimize the risk to your self. The worst thing you could do is come in from the front, all calm and \"I\\'m here to help, please don\\'t hit me\" cause they will. They can\\'t help it, they\\'re not thinking they\\'re just reacting. Dominate the situation. Wait - Sounds mean, but if they\\'re drowning, just wait, they will go unconscious soon enough, then you can move them to land and use CPR if needed. Keep in mind you should use the same rules as \"touch\". This actually will have a higher success rate than you, as an untrained person, jumping in the water and trying to subdue them and get them back to land, but only works well in situations where you know the water. If they\\'re freaking out in a pool or lake, or the like, where you can reach the bottom. That\\'s why it\\'s last. It doesn\\'t work everywhere. I can\\'t stress enough, that this situation is a lot like CPR. Screw the broken ribs, compress the chest. Some of the stuff in this answer may seem \"mean\" if your doing them to your room mate in the living room, but if the person is in distress in the water your going to do more damage being \"nice\" then doing what needs to be done. At the same time \"Touch\" is really a bad idea. If you have no choice and you decide to try, as an untrained person your much more likely to just drown your self. You really need to consider all options. The absolute worse thing you can do is get in the water and make the situation more difficult by getting into trouble yourself.',\n",

For example, to avoid any swings that would crash the climber into the rock. There are many examples on safety-related criteria for determining tension (safety for both the climber and the belayer), but the list is long and I don\\'t think I\\'d be able to sum it all here, so I won\\'t be listing examples. Learning to belay requires you to learn many things, and actually teaches you to think differently about safety and security. It\\'s also a lot of fun and very exciting. Do consider taking proper training for this though; it\\'s a good investment. If available, face-to-face training is irreplaceable, IMO. There are many books and videos but you\\'ll gain more experience by discussing with other people. And regardless of whether you get face-to-face training or not, my advice is always the same: keep asking, always assume someone knows something you don\\'t, never take an answer blindly as true, read, research, ask again, ask more. Personal preference Safety issues being said, the rest may be just a matter of personal preference. If the rope is travelling perfectly in line with your climb, excessive tension might just be reassurance to novice climbers (make them feel that the rope is really there to catch them). However, if the rope is travelling sideways, for example, it\\'s usually counterproductive for the climber. Like you say, it effectively pulls you off the wall. Most of the experienced climbers I know (if not all) agree that you shouldn\\'t need tension in the rope (unless the belayer identifies an actual security risk). The rationale is that the rope is there to catch you only in the event that you fall, but not to help pull you upwards (nor to help you keep balance). When I was taught to rock-climb, the program included \"trust games\". These were meant to build confidence on the climber regarding the belayer, rope, harness, and the whole security chain. Personally, I still like some tension when I feel I\\'m still too close to the ground but will ask for \"slack\" when at a reasonable height. Sometimes I\\'ll also ask for tension when trying out the crux in a route. TL;DR version There might be a \"safe zone\" on a given route. A belayer should have proper training to identify actual security reasons for determining tension. Other than that, tension is mostly a means of providing reassurance to novice climbers (or experienced climbers who just prefer it one way or another).',\n",

Holding your partner's weight for the entire duration of a self rescue would be a bad idea. Building an anchor is independent of what your partner is doing. Always build an anchor. On glaciers, you'll most likely build a deadman anchor with an ice axe. It's possible to do a deadman with a ski, but it's time consuming and probably impossible to do alone while holding your partner. Crevasse rescue with a team of two just adds to the complexity. At a minimum, you'll need to be able to arrest the fall, build an anchor, transfer the load, check on your partner, build a haul system, and effect the rescue. Oh, and you'll be by yourself. Most likely, you'll be traveling with knots in the rope. Your best luck for a haul system is a Canadian drop loop (6:1) system. This provides enough mechanical advantage for a single rescuer to pull a victim out.

No , but it does depend on your rope rating, here's why: Twin ropes are rated to be used as a pair, they aren't UIAA rated to to take the requisite number of falls individually. When climbing with twin ropes you climb as though you only have one rope and always clip them both together. If you're following a wandering line, you need to extend your protection as you would when climbing with a single rope. If you were to switch from twin to half-rope technique on twin ropes, then take a fall, you're going to fall twice as far because all the force is going into one rope which will over stress it, over stretch it, and present an increased likelihood of failure. Half ropes, are always clipped individually, there is never a need to twin-clip them, and doing so actually will double the impact force on your protection and onto your body when you do take a fall. The ropes are individually rated to catch you, so if you double up then you're more likely to cause your protection to fail, as well as sustain injury. Only clip one of your ropes at a time when you're half roping. Here's the catch: some ropes are rated for single, twin and half rope technique. These ropes could accommodate you in whatever unique situation you find yourself in. There is one school of thought that is concerned about rope rub when alternating techniques, but there is another that says the amount of potential friction generated is negligible. One rope rubbing over another might cause some damage, but two rope slipping past each other is less concerning.\",\n",

Full story Today I saved someone's life. I think some strange forces were at work. I planned to ski by myself today. As fate had it though, some good friends ended up recognizing me despite my ski gear, and we joined forces for an epic pow day. Again, fate intervened. One of our crew got his backpack strap stuck in the chairlift as he tried to unload and the lift dragged him back down the hill. We were on the chair lift behind so we unloaded and ran down the hill to help him when we realized the worst possible thing had happened. The backpack had wrapped around his neck and he was unconscious, dangling 10 feet above the snow. Panic set in and we struggled in vain for about a minute to build a human pyramid to get to him but the powder was too deep and we toppled over. I yelled at the lift operator asking if the lift ran in reverse and he cried no. Ski patrol was on their way but not there yet. Panic was becoming terror as we realized we were about to watch our friend die in front of our helpless eyes. Then I had a eureka moment. I realized I could climb the lift tower above the chair and climb onto the cable and shimmy down to him. I knew my slackline experience prepared me perfectly for this so I burst into action. I climbed the tower and slid down to the the chair. It was second nature, just like being on a slackline only way colder and made of steel. I climbed down the chair and I first tried to break the strap by kicking it but I couldn't. A newly arrived ski patrolman threw me a knife and I luckily caught it on the first try and cut the strap. Our friend fell like a doll into the snow. 8 or so ski patrolman then began CPR. Thankfully they were able to restore his breathing, ski him down to the base, and get him into an ambulance which rushed him to the hospital in Denver. I'd like to take this moment now to thank the #slacklife for the skills it has given me. It was incredibly fortunate I was there and able to act quickly. I'd also like to thank ski patrol for their strong work reviving our friend.

If you want to do that, here\\'s one way to (there are several). I did this in the past to help a party of less experienced people cross a slope full of unstable snow. First, get a lightweight rope. It does not have to be a rock climbing rope - and it should better not be. Rock climbing ropes are dynamic, that is, elastic , and you don\\'t want to get something elastic here, but something that holds tight. Moreover, rock climbing ropes would be too weighty and in most cases too long: that means, overkill. This one could be fine (it is explicitly meant to be used as an \"handrail\") but in my opinion something thinner may work as well, like a 5.5mm cordelette . The length is up to you and the trail you want to do. Realistically, if you need anything longer than 20m, probably yes, you\\'d better be somewhere else. Also get a sewn sling like this and a pear-shaped rock climbing carabiner. Now for the tying itself. I will keep things simple and assume that you will have something sturdy to attach your rope to - that means, trees. It would be of course pointless to assume that you need to also carry cams, nuts, piton, and other rock climbing gear. So, you have trees. If there aren\\'t trees in the hike you\\'re planning, don\\'t even bother carrying that rope. Tie one rope end to a tree before the tricky part. There are several ways to do that. The bowline is one option, it is described here . Move up - or across - the tricky section while trailing the rope. Reach for the safer place and find another three up there. Wrap your sling around the tree and clip the carabiner into it. Tie the rope into the carabiner by using a clove hitch and tension the rope as much as you can before tightening it. You\\'re done. If you\\'re going back by the same route, leave it there. When you will get back last, you will dismantle the top anchor and then the bottom one. If not, the last member of the party will need to untie the bowline and get up with the rope not tight. Practice it in a safe place several times . Go to any park and do that with threes, fences, or whatever you may be able to find. Remember that any person would be way safer if scrambling with her foot and hands than by leaning onto a rope that is not tied properly and that would slip off. Just think of it. If you don\\'t use any rope while moving, your weight is on your feet. If you hang on the rope, you partially unload your feet to weight the rope. If the rope fails now, you\\'re out of balance and very likely, fall.',\n",

But as with anything that is potentially dangerous, the most important part is for everyone (in particular the one in the water) to be prepared, which can only be seen to in advance. One technical but sometimes overlooked aspect is that when you are the one crawling on the ice, you shouldn't try to stand up until you are back on thick enough ice. When using rescue claws/nails/spikes to get up yourself, try to crawl further than you actually think you need to! Otherwise, the hole just gets bigger and bigger and you exhaust yourself by repeating the procedure. This same principle is behind the ideas of ladders, boards etc. The important part is to distribute the weight on a big area. And if you're really far away from civilisation, calling for help by helicopter or so is obviously a good idea. But I would suggest trying to save the person before doing that, as it is going to take an eternity for the helicopter to arrive compared to how fast you drown when the water is freezing. Just a note: here in Sweden it is very common for schools to teach the basic theory of ice safety, combined with practise. I think going into the water and getting up yourself should be a mandatory prerequisite before going on any serious ice adventure.\",\n",

I have had the same roll of braided nylon string (masons line) in my backpack for over ten years now, and I use it for everything . A roll of 500ft fits in your hand, it's light, and it's surprisingly strong–I've never had it break on me–but I've also never used it to hold body weight, though with 500ft, you could string a few strands together which would certainly hold body weight, and seriously, a roll of 500ft last forever.

Random repairs Hanging a computer monitor from a curtain rod... And I know I've used it for many many other things as well, it's just super handy to have strong lightweight string. The only thing about it is that it's got some stretch to it, and if you use it for lashing off the roll without gloves it cuts into your hands because of how thin it is, but everything I've lashed with it has been super solid. If you leave it on the roll while tying then you can use the roll as a handle to help you get some comfy leverage and get things real tight. Just like other cords, there are lots of brands/varieties, so maybe test a couple strings to find a real strong one (I'm pretty sure I got my roll in a crafts store).

Second: even a 10m + lanyard fall should not be fatal if you use a proper modern via ferrata set - those are designed to rip open in a controlled manner to absorb the fall energy. A well-designed via ferrata should not have ledges in the fall zone, but I'd also say that 10m vertical distance without an anchor is not acceptable given that via ferrata sets are tested only on a 5m fall. However, clipping one of your carabiners into closed rungs seems a reasonable measure to reduce the fall length, and advisable in places where a via ferrata is not well designed. Possible reasons not to do it: conceptually, the rungs are not safety equipment, they exist to make the ascent easier. it slows you down and leaves you more frequently holding on with one hand on a vertical section, which increases your risk of falling as you become more exhausted. it complicates what you have to do and imposes more choices on you, which increases the chance that you'll make a dangerous mistake, e.g. you're in the process of moving one carabiner from a lower to a higher rung when you notice the other carabiner is holding you back because it's up against a cable anchor. Your attention now focused on the second carabiner, you reach down to unclip it while the first one is still unclipped in your other hand...\",\n",

Usually what is taught in basic climbing and self rescue courses is to ascend with two prusik loops: One for you foot, and one for your weight. Ascending with an ATC is ok because it is more \"fail proof\", though. The reason I mentioned using two prusiks is more basic is because my answer includes transitioning to a prusik loop in order to re-set your ATC in abseil mode. The process is simple and intuitive: Suppose you have the exact situation described in your picture, where you use a loop for your foot placed above the ATC and have your weight placed in the ATC itself. Now you should: Take a second prusik loop and use it to grab the rope above your foot loop (with a marchant knot or some variation), clipping your personal anchoring system (PAS) into it, creating a primary; Do exactly the same procedure you were doing before, but instead of taking slack in through your ATC, move the primary upwards - this means that when you rest, your weight will be placed on the primary above, not on the ATC; Move your second loop (the one you were using for your foot) upwards until it comes near the primary, clipping a sling to it and using it as a backup; You are now attached to two prusik loops above your ATC device, so you have a primary fixed point and a backup. You are ready to disconnect your ATC in lead mode, which is now absolutely unweighted. Do so and reposition it in abseil mode, using a third prusik as a backup under the ATC to catch the rope (this backup prusik can be the loop you\\'re using as a backup, since the rope is already passed through your ATC and you don\\'t need two backups); Your weight now rests on the primary, and your ATC is ready to be abseiled from. Take a long quickdraw, a loop or anything you can step on, and place it on the primary itself. Step on it grabbing your PAS to balance as you take the rope slack in through your ATC, adjusting the backup below it or simply using your hand in order to pass the weight to the ATC; Your weight is now placed on the ATC and everything else is free to be removed.

And I can tell you from experience that a glacier rescue is scary, stressful and exhausting, and that was with a party of 4 fit and experienced adults. If you have to ask the question, you simply don't have the skills to execute safely. Two highly skilled adults on a glacier with hidden crevasses is very sketchy: it can be difficult to hold a fall and even more difficult to extract - often impossible if the faller is injured. There is no way the kid could hold the adult, never mind rescue them from the crevasse. It would be grossly irresponsible to venture onto a dangerous glacier with just an adult and child on the rope. With two skilled adults and a kid you are effectively in the same marginal situation as two adults on their own, but with additional risks and responsibilities. The kid won't have the weight, skill or temperament to be anything other than a hindrance if anything goes wrong. And if it's the kid who falls in, it might be a traumatic experience for them even if they don't get injured.

Some gyms have it just over the top of the bar (180 degrees of contact), while others give it an additional full wrap around (540 degrees of contact). In the former setup, a belayer can hold the static weight of a climber who weighs roughly twice as much as she does; the friction between the rope and the pulley keeps it from slipping. In the latter setup, the factor is much larger, maybe 10 or more. In your chin-up bar test setup, I assume you had 180 degrees of contact. When you say she could \"barely hold\" your weight, are you describing a situation where she was simply sitting in her harness with her weight hung from her end of the rope? She shouldn\\'t be trying to hold the weight with her hands. Only a relatively small force from her braking hand (below the belay device) should be needed in order to keep the rope from slipping through the device. If it\\'s in doubt whether your partner\\'s body weight is enough to suspend you, she should anchor herself to a weight or to a carabiner connected to the floor.

       "    'body': \"I assume you are only looking for options by going from belay to belay (as opposed to continuous securing like going on taught rope). Method using half-ropes: You tie in on both ropes, your partners on a single one each. They belay you normally on both ropes until you set up the belay-station. Then you secure them using a Munter hitch or a tuber like system to belay them. Using a tuber is preferable, as it autoblocks and does not twist the ropes around each other. They can climb simultaneously, just having to keep a minimal distance, which depends a lot on how fast the rope is pulled in by the belayer. Advantages: Both partners can go at their one pace (as long as the faster one starts first). One falling does not affect the other. Disadvantages: Two half ropes are heavier than one single rope. The belayer has two ropes to manage Method using one single rope You obviously tie in on one end, the partner which climbs best on the other end. The weaker partner ties in at a save distance from the end. The exact distance is always a compromise between available rope length and safety margin between climbers. The one in the middle can be tied in using a variety of knots, I prefer an overhand secured by a double fisherman's knot. The weaker one starts climbing and the second one follows as soon as the rope in between them is almost taught. If the first falls, this does not affect the second. But if the second falls, he will pull the first off the rock. Advantages: Only one rope needed which is lighter than half ropes. Disadvantages: The second has to climb exactly at the pace of the first. The second has to be fairly competent as a fall will pull off the first. The usable rope length per pitch is reduced by the distance between the partners Method using two single ropes You tie in on one end of the first rope, one partner ties in on this and the second rope. The other ties in on the other end of the second rope. After you led the pitch the first partner climbs it and clips the second rope into the protection. If the pitch goes sideways and he is insecure, the second partner which is still down at the previous belay can belay him from behind. Thus falls with swings can be caught. After the first partner reached your belay, the second one climbs the pitch. Advantages: Very easy to handle. Perfectly save, especially in traverses for the first partner. full rope length available for pitches. Disadvantages: very slow (nearly twice as long as with half ropes) heaviest setup as you carry two full ropes I would always prefer the half-rope method, its the fastest and save. And the additional weight should not be an issue, after all you are three climbers. If you really do not want to handle two ropes (though it is very easy, just try it out) I would recommend the method using one single rope. The last method is really just in case you need the rope length, and both your partners struggle with the grade you are using or you are insecure handling two ropes (again, thats a none-issue). And keep in mind: You are always a lot slower in a three person rope team than with two.\",\n",

To Contrast here is huka falls, a waterfall that even hundreds of meters upstream you cannot safely cross because of the heavy currents and lack of exit points from the river. In general you should avoid any water crossing with any meaningful current; unless you have whitewater experience or you can maintain your footing, shin deep or less, the entire time. In an emergency type scenario ropes can be helpful to mitigate risks, but require careful application as they add complexity to a potentially dangerous situation. Again experience goes a long way.

We've often tied the belayer in with a few feet of slack so the belayer is pulled up (and can even give a little jump late in the catch, especially on a clean 90 degree wall). Doing this will avoid that abrupt jerk when the rope comes taught. It's that abrupt jerk that pendulums you into the rock at an uncomfortable pace (and can break ankles). You fall a few extra feet (which comes with risks if you're not on a clean 90 degree wall, so consider your particular situation), but it really softens the catch. However the belayer definitely has to be aware that they'll be pulled off their feet, and need to be in a comfortable position to accommodate this. We often like to tie into the anchor using a bite in the rope on our multi-pitch routes. Easy tie-in, and you can easily set the slack the belayer has.\",\n",

EDIT: If you're concerned about your edge protector flipping over, they do make Roll modules for moving ropes that have both vertical and horizontal rollers: There are a lot of different styles of edge protectors and edge rollers, but you can typically find them or order them at rescue supply stores. A slightly more affordable option is a rope pad: Same idea as the rollers, but made out of heavy duty material instead of metal, and you run the ropes trough a sleeve. You asked specifically for climbing with dynamic ropes, but I figured I's show the cheap and easy method for single rope rappels too: I use a Spirol Rope Protector and I really like it, it's flexible but very durable rubber, and it wraps around your rope. A couple things I like about are that you can leave it on your rope when it's coiled, and you can make it slide along the rope, which is handy if you need to rappel with it a ways to get down to whatever sharp edge you're going over. It doesn't slide on it's own very easily, but it's got a small hole in it so you can tie a rat tail stopper or something with some small cord just in case.

       "    'body': 'I wanted to mention two additional scenarios not covered by Ben Crowell\\'s great answer. When it is possible to fall past the belayer (on a multi-pitch climb, or when getting to the start of a climb involves a scramble or stepping out onto the face,) the fall factor is the greatest. In those cases the old mantra \"the leader must not fall\" still very much applies. If you fall past your belayer without having clipped any protection yet, you are experiencing a factor 2 fall (falling twice the distance of the length of rope out), which can create enough force to break climbing equipment, rip bolts or protection out of the wall, and cause serious injuries or death to you and your climbing partner, even if you fall for just a very short distance. (To prevent this scenario, place a piece of protection as soon as possible. Until then, don\\'t fall!) When you are clipping to gear that is above your tie-in-point , you can fall even further than twice the distance to your last piece. Example: You clipped the first bolt, which was 15 feet (4.6 m) above ground, now you are standing 4 feet (1.2 m) above the first bolt and within reach of the second bolt, which was only 10 feet (3 m) past the first. Clipping involves lifting the rope 4 feet (1.2m) from your tie-in-point. At first thought you should be fine, right? You are standing just four feet (1.2 m) above your last piece, and the first clip was after 15 feet (4.6m.) In fact this is a very dangerous situation. When you are just about to clip, the actual amount of rope out is: 15 feet to the first bolt, 10 feet to the next bolt, and 4 feet back down to your tie-in-point, totaling 29 feet of rope, plus maybe a foot of rope of slack your belayer is giving you plus rope stretch that will occur during your fall. In this scenario you could fall 14-19 feet (4.2-5.8 m) past your last piece which is going to result in a ground fall !!! (To prevent this scenario, avoid clipping to something that is higher than your shoulders, and, whenever possible, clip when your protection is near or past your tie-in-point.) Climbing is full of little surprises like this ( force multiplications , the physics of pendulum falls , the zipper effect , factor 2 falls ... to just name a few.) I am all for figuring stuff out myself, but with climbing I highly recommend learning from a climber with several years of experience, or taking a class. Just reading a book or post on a Q&A site is not going to be enough to stay safe until you have a very thorough understanding of everything involved.',\n",

We use Static rope and caving descenders are usually designed to only use a single strand of rope. We double the rope and tie a knot with a small loop near the middle of the rope. Then feed one end of the rope through the anchor (usually a bolt and hanger of some kind) so that the two sides of the rope are parallel as in your diagram, with the knot and loop near the anchor. Then we clip a carabiner to the loop formed by the knot and clip this carabiner to the other side of the rope. The next step is than to abseil down using the end of the rope passing through the carabiner (the side without the knot). This causes the rope to pull through the carabiner and tighten around the anchor. When the last person is down, you pull down the rope using the other side of the rope from which was abseiled down (the side with the knot and loop) and continue on your way. Obviously you need to take extreme care and not abseil on the wrong side of the rope. This can be mitigated against by clipping the carabiner to the anchor until the last person is on the rope and ready to abseil. They double check they have attached their descender to the correct side of the rope and then unclip the carabiner from the anchor and abseil down. Also you can coil the \"pull-down\" side of the rope and keep it at the top if the pitch until the last person is ready to abseil and lowers this end down, in order to prevent someone attaching to the wrong side of the rope.',\n",

       "    'body': 'Short roping is an advanced technique, but it is a necessary one to progress quickly and safely in the mountains. As with most techniques, knowing when to apply it just as important (or more) as the technique itself. The safety in short-roping comes from three main ingredients: Coaching the climber through easy moves. Preventing a slip from turning into a fall. Being able to quickly switch to belayed mode. The last point is often overlooked in discussions on roped travel safety. There are many cases where a rope is superfluous on some part of a climb, but a short difficult section is coming up. When this happens, the climbers are left to either (a) stop, pull out the rope, rope up, etc. or (b) proceed unroped. One wastes time, the other is unsafe. Being short-roped allows the first climber to say \"hey, stop and wait here\", drop hand coils, climb up a moderately difficult section quickly, then use a basic belay (e.g., a rock horn, a quick cam, boot axe, etc.). When a longer difficult section is coming up, you can even start dropping kiwi coils to have a full rope length available. To recap, the only times I will short-rope are: The short-roping climber (\"guide\") is 110% comfortable on the terrain, and the risk of a fall is zero (for them). The short-roped climber (\"client\") is perhaps less experienced and can use some coaching, but is not very likely to fall either. This is why guides and experienced climbers often use short-rope. Furthermore, the short-roping climber is always in a position to assist the short-roped climber: preventing a slip from becoming a fall, providing guidance (\"left hand here\"), etc... Generally, this precludes short-roping from being used safely in technical terrain where the climbers need to use their hands. The short-roping climber is always above the short-roped climber: going first when climbing up, going behind when climbing down. The two climbers should be close together: as close as possible without kicking each other. More rope in the system makes it effectively impossible to prevent a slip from turning into a fall; there\\'s just too much slack and stretch in the system. The rope should be relatively tight: when going up, the short-roping climber must feel their partner through the rope. If the rope has any slack in it, it will be impossible to sense a slip. Both climbers should have a kiwi coil, and the short-roping climber carries 4-6 coils of rope in their hand. Short-roping with three (or more!) climbers is reserved for expert Swiss mountain guides named Wili. As with all things in the mountains, prevention is better than a cure : if you\\'re really worried about a fall and are still short-roping, you\\'re probably doing something wrong. Done correctly, short-roping can provide extra confidence for a weaker climber, and respond quickly in the event of a slip. Most importantly, the rope is already ready to be used for a quick belay when the terrain gets harder. Short-roping is not for everyone, but it is a valid strategy for traveling safely and quickly in the mountains. In my experience, it\\'s the only way to cover enough ground on the relatively easy terrain to do the bigger objectives. In some cases, it\\'s the only (reasonably) available protection strategy; e.g., on knife edge ridges such as the Aiguille de Rochefort .',\n",

How you approach belaying will depend on whether the climber is leading or using a top-anchor. About the only thing I can state absolutely over the internet - you always need to have a grip on the rope that is trailing from your belay/friction device down to the ground.

       "    'body': \"One method is to build a brake out of carabiners. The minimum equipment for this is three oval biners plus a locking biner, and the diagrams below show how to construct the system with only this many biners. However, this setup doesn't give much friction, especially with a thin rope, and normally people use at least one more oval, as described in the text below. To construct the brake start with the usual large locking biner clipped to your belay loop, as you would for any rappel. The diagrams show a double-strand rappel. Clip the two oval biners A and B, with their gates opposite and opposed, through the locking biner. Pull a bight through the ovals. Insert your third oval, C, through the bight, with the spine oriented as shown. Clip the load strands back through the sideways biner C. Flip C around and over the tops of A and B, forming a crossbar with its spine. Make sure that the rope ended up passing over the spine of C, not its gate. As noted previously, the setup shown in figure 4 doesn't really give much friction. If you have a fourth oval biner D, it's a good idea to add it next to C, so that they form a sort of double-thickness crossbar. Both C and D should have their spines touching the rope, not their gates. (They can be reversed, but not opposed.) Only A and B should be opposite and opposed. Don't try to do without the locking biner. If you simply clip A and B to your belay loop, the rope will rub against your belay loop and possibly destroy it through intense frictional heating. It is OK, however, to replace the locking biner with a pair of nonlocking biners, opposite and opposed. The standard braking position for this standard setup is to hold the brake strand down at your hip, just as you would with an ATC. If you raise the brake strand to a higher angle, it could press against the gates of C and D, possibly causing them to open. There are various ways of increasing the friction. If you have a huge load to lower and lots of oval biners, you can build two of these brakes in series. You can rearrange the brake bars to send the rope through in an S shape. In comments, Steed suggests using a locking biner for C, in which case it becomes safe to brake with the brake strand raised. A possible advantage of the carabiner brake over a Munter is that the Munter will tend to twist up your rope. A possible disadvantage is that you may not have enough oval biners.

       "    'body': \"A crevasse that wide cannot just be jumped across (unless you're among the top long jumpers of the world), therefore you have only two possibilities: avoid it or build a bridge over it. Typically such bridges are built using aluminum ladders (cf. image below) that are placed across the crevasse and fixed on both sides. In the ideal case one also builds some handrail rope to hold onto. As you can see from the image such bridges are rather permanent constructions, that need some material (ice screws, rope, webbing slings) to get it properly fixed. Also for a crevasse of 7.5m width you can plan for a minimum of 10m (better more) of ladder to have enough spare lengths on both sides for support and fixation. So this is nothing that you carry up the mountain just for the possibility to need it but you will have to plan ahead to bring the right material. It also requires some time to set it up, therefore such ladders are only of use on points where a crevasse is frequently crossed. As you say you plan or at least expect to go solo on that trip, you won't have the capacity to carry huge amounts of material. In that case your second best choice will be to find a snow bridge over the crevasse. As those bridges (and also the snowy edges of crevasses) can look firm while being quite unstable, be very careful with your safety measures. That means, create a save anchor (using ice screws, snow protection gear , or whatever is suitable for the conditions) some meters away from the edge and tie your rope there. Cross the snow bridge while you are belayed by the rope. Once on the other side, create another anchor there and fix your rope here as well. If you can afford, leave the rope there until you return to have an easier traverse on your way back (also take into account that you might need to take a fast retreat). If you can't leave the rope there, cross the bridge back again to your first anchor (of course while being secured by the rope somehow), remove the rope and anchor and get back to your second anchor by crossing the bridge a third time. You see, the snow bridge variant requires to put your life onto some anchor built into snow with the risk of hanging on a rope somewhere down in the crevasse. You should be very sure to know how to rescue yourself from a crevasse and have the necessary gear with you. So in your situation it would clearly be the best choice to take a detour to avoid crossing the crevasse.\",\n",

Since we will have several such sections of climbing and regular hiking between them I thought that clipping and unclipping carabiners would be much faster (mind the fact that I will safeguard all three kids). The scrambling sections themselves are not very long, so they will not take much time to pass. There are anchors on top of each section, so my plan was that I climb, clip the rope, then probably go down and safeguard my kids one-by-one (there will be more adults). There will be no hard falls, since I'll watch them and will keep the rope tight through my belaying device. Having that convenience of fast clip/unclip is hugely important and also safer.

I\\'d put rope into three main categories based on thickness: disposable rope, like thin sisal, medium general purpose rope with a breaking strength of a few hundred kg, and climbing rope, which is generally rated for breaking at 2000 kg, or 20 kN. The heavier ropes can do anything the lighter categories can do, but they\\'re much bulkier and heavier to lug around. So, if you\\'re only going to be tying shelters together, tie a tarp up, maybe a washing line, stuff where you don\\'t need strength or grip, grap a few dozen meters of sisal or cheap cord. If you mostly plan on making rafts, lowering gear down a cliff or getting it across a stream dry, using rope in emergency first aid (pressure bandage, splint, tourniquet if absolutely necessary), tug small boats, tie lots of stuff down on a car/bicycle/donkey or even carry people on your back in an improvised backpack fashion the medium rope is the best choice. Paracord is a good option, as is prusik rope or, quite possibly my personal favorite, some flat webbing, about 15 mm, coarse weave. But while those ropes are strong enough to hold a person, they will not catch a falling one. The medium rope will break on you while climbing. In a real emergency, with a light climber, keeping the line tight, maybe using several ropes braided together, maybe. But if you plan on climbing, bring the real stuff. Same for if you want to be able to tow vehicles (an actual tow cable or a winch setup is still better of course, but this will generally work if you\\'re careful) or do any other real heavy lifting. 1 inch tubular webbing, either climb spec of mil spec, is awesome stuff for a lot of applications. Its limitation is that it will only reliably catch a grown person falling up to about 2 meters. Above that you need dynamic rope. When you\\'re climbing up a cliff putting in your own anchor points, dynamic climbing rope. But for something like abseiling or top-roping static ropes are fine. A major downside is that for many of the applications that require real strong rope, you need a lot of it. Especially for climbing a few dozen meters of rope is not too much of a luxury. Most of the medium strength stuff can be done with a few meters of rope, and the lightest knotting you can do with any rope often requires no more than scraps. At the same time, 50 meters of thin sisal easily fits in your pocket, being the size of maybe 4 meters of medium strength rope or just 1 of the heavy stuff.

I am volunteering in the german mountain rescue service, but I am in no way an expert in climbing security - so please take everything below with a grain of salt. 1.1 We use redundancies for virtually every type of rescue but there is usually a lot more weight involved (1-4 rescue personell + 1 patient + up to 100kg of equipment). However \"redundancy\" means two completly seperate systems : Two Ropes, two breaking mechanisms, two (or more) attachement points, etc. Using just a second carabiner would not qualify here, as you still have a single point of failure (e.g. the rope). Using only two ropes is even worse, as rope-on-rope is actively dangerous! However : In four years of climbing, I have not seen a single person climbing recreationally with that kind of redundancy. Your hardware and rope usually have 22+ kN of strength (which is 2.2 metric TONS of static weight entry) - I am pretty sure that every bone in your body would shatter before your carabine does... 1.2 Is 1+1=2 applicable here? The easy answer is no. While it may depend on the specific case, you usually cannot ensure that both systems (ropes, hardware, etc.) have the weight (or impact) distributed equally between them. And if one of them snaps to beeing overburdend - the other one is sure to follow... 2 Yes, using a figure 8 carbine is a way to rappel (and was used here for many years!). We removed them in favor of the ATC-Guide (a tuber) onto which you can easily add a dead-man switch with a prusik. Just be sure to know how to properly use it. TL;DR: I see no reason to use redundant systems in personal/recreational climbing. Get certified gear and learn how to use it properly . Take care of yourself. Be safe. Your life is not worth the savings on a cheap rope. And when in doubt, don\\'t be afraid to ask the professionals (DAV in germany, UIAA internationally for example). Lastly I think it is taking a look at the accident statistic of your local climbing association. There is rarely/never a case a rope just snaps - there usually is some kind of mishandling (or shard cliffedge!) involved. Reading through that shows you the common pitfalls - and hopefully makes you remember them! :)',\n",

As the area is really small and surrounded by roads, it would be hard to get lost so you could wander around the woods off the trails for an afternoon if that is what you want. Arnold Arboretum is much bigger and you could conceivably spend an afternoon on trails (or you could find a secluded spot and sit). A little further out, but still inside RT 128, are Quincy Quarries/Blue Hills Reservation, Middlesex Fells, and Lynn Woods. You can definitely spend 1/2 a day wandering the trails in these parks. Middlesex Fells and Blue Hills are more T accessible than Lynn Woods.

In fact, I wouldn\\'t even try finding a campsite later than afternoon on Friday or on Saturday. As for hiking, look at maps to see what the hiking opportunities are by each campground you are considering. A good place to start is with the state-wide trails map. https://www.mass-trails.org/map/ma.html#map=10/42.38746/-72.83798 is zoomed in on the western part of the state. Zoom in more, and you\\'ll see individual trails. By the way, that web site was created by a member of our Town of Groton Trails Committee. It was modeled after our very successful interactive trails map that he also created, expanded to the whole state. The data is harvested from OpenStreetMap, but displayed in a trail-centric way. After some poking around on that map, you\\'ll see there are many many hiking opportunities all over MA. Even in just the \"hill towns\" area (from the NY border east to the edge of the Connecticut Valley), there is a wide range. This includes the popular AT and areas around Mt Greylock, to much more obscure woods walks and other local hikes of all types of terrain. Off-road vehicles are allowed in some places, like many of the trails in October Mountain State Park. As a hiker, you might want to avoid those areas. There are still plenty of trails what won\\'t have dirt bikes and the like on them (at least not legally).',\n",

       "    'body': 'In general, you want to be in the south during winter. Another problem is that parks are more dispersed in the east. One strategy might be to start in the northeast (which basically means Acadia) as late in the season as you can handle, then move down the east coast as the weather gets cooler, getting to the Everglades in the depth of winter. You then go north out of Florida and west along the gulf coast into Texas and the southwest, then zig-zag across the west going more north each time. You end up in maybe Isle Royal, depending how your zigging and zagging goes. That\\'s the basic plan, but there are some major wrinkles that effectively mean you don\\'t end up following the nice and neat plan you laid out. Some parks aren\\'t really park-like at all without any camping and in the middle of cities. If you\\'re looking for a nature adventure, cross these off your list. These include places like the customs house in Salem MA, the liberty bell in Philadelphia, various places in Washington DC, etc. Even sticking to \"nature\" national parks, you have to consider elevation and general climate. Roosevelt Elk on the California coast has a much milder climate than Lassen just a couple 100 miles inland at the same latitude. The road thru Roosevelt Elk is probably open all year, but Lassen is probably snow-bound and closed until July. Even within a park, there are differences due to altitude. The valley in Yosemite has quite a different season than Tenya Road, for example. I\\'d start by getting a decent size map of the US, then sticking a pin at each park, color coded by how far into summer you need to visit. You\\'ll find it\\'s not a simple problem to visit them all in a year and still enjoy the individual stays while minimizing driving between any two. You\\'ll also want to stay longer in some parks while you\\'ll be fine with just a quick one-day visit at others. Personally, I\\'d rather spend more time in Rocky Mountain, Glacier, and Yellowstone, than small single-attraction places like Fossil Fish Beds. You may also be \"stuck\" in the south disproportionately longer during winter. You might end up hanging out in Big Bend or Death Valley, for example, for a couple of weeks.',\n",

Bikes are faster than hiking, allowing you to explore more trail in a day, make the descents a lot easier, and also enable older people who can\\'t hike well (bad knees) to still enjoy a gentle trail by cycling. The arguments against are mainly related to trail maintenance and safety. Bikes can make a mess out of muddy hiking trails, especially when strong cyclists try to pedal through the mud and dig up ruts, but maintenance wise that the only con to a bike, unless you want to include tire tracks on rocks. The main concern is safety; people bombing down a popular trail and colliding with hikers, or scaring horses, which usually results in people getting bucked off and hurt. Parks are concerned about liability. Mountain Biking is a high speed sport, and high speed sports are all capable of producing serious injuries. Park officials don\\'t want to have to deal with crashes and wipeouts, or complaints from jumpy hikers about that crazy cyclist who passed them going \"dangerously fast\". Parks are all about keeping the peace, which mostly means the peace and quiet in the administration building, they don\\'t want to deal with paperwork, which incidents of any type create for them.

For example, I often use a Android tablet with a built-in GPS, and software that can record waypoints and tracks on pre-loaded maps. So the answer is, record the lat/lon coordinates of the spot you want to come back to. It can also help to record a GPS track on your way in and out. You can follow these tracks or get to the spot later without any alterations of the land. Unless you own the land or otherwise have explicit permission, Do not Leave flags. Make cairns. Cut blazes. Make chalk marks. Do anything else that mars the land, rocks, trees or anything else, or leaves a deliberate visible trace of you having been there. All these are vandalism and just plain rude without permission of whoever has authority over the land. And no, it being public land doesn't give you the automatic right to do these things, at least not here in the US. Also consider that maybe you shouldn't even be off a existing trail in the first place. Wandering around freely is allowed in many public lands, but staying on established trails is required in others. Don't assume you can wander off trail without making sure it is actually allowed on that particular property. More on chalk marks Some apparently believe that it's OK to go one someone else's land and mark it up with chalk, and even worse, indicate a whole new trail. In most case, that is not so. I would be upset if someone did that on my land. Even in cases where the public has permission to walk on the land off-trail freely, marking a new trail still isn't right without explicit permission. In my town, there are no general restrictions on walking around on town-owned conservation land. I am on both the Trails Committee (who does the planning, construction, and maintenance of trails) and the Conservation Commission (who is the authority that would grant permission for a new trail on such lands). I can tell you we'd take a dim view of anyone marking a new trail with chalk. While the chalk marks alone are vandalism, the real issue is the new trail being marked. Others will likely see it and follow it, and now it becomes marked just from the wear of usage. It also gives others the impression that it's OK for anyone to mark a trail. This is not a sustainable situation, and would make work for the volunteers that manage the conservation lands and the trail system. Most people not on the Trails Committee or the ConCom have no idea about what restrictions there might have been imposed on a property when it was acquired, deals made about trails with other entities holding CRs (conservation restrictions), research and thought that went into NOT putting a trail in a particular place, future plans for where trails will be, where particularly sensitive environmental areas are, etc. Someone just barging in can cause real damage. It can also derail negotiations between different groups about trail placements and the like. What I mention above are not just academic points. These things have actually happened. In one case someone put a bridge across a ditch to make it easy to cross. We were in the middle of trying to convince the CR holder to allow us to put a bridge there. As you can imagine, a bridge suddenly appearing there without permission didn't go over well. Now all the trails in a whole section of that parcel are not allowed to be maintained and are essentially closed. In another case, a trail was proposed and had gotten as far as being flagged with yellow tape, all with proper permission. It was then found this went too close to some vernal pools where the endangered blue spotted salamander was found. It was decided to not route a trail thru that area, and all the flags were carefully removed. We don't want anyone even giving the impression of a trail near those vernal pools. Again, you simply don't have the right to mark a new trail on someone else's land without permission. Here in the US, you must assume that permission is not given unless done so explicitly. Making a few chalk marks may seem harmless because they will be washed away after a while with no real environmental harm, but again, that's not the point. How would you feel if I put a bunch of chalk marks on your house? Sure, they'll wash away after a while, but that doesn't make it right.\",\n",

For example, I've put in some trails for specific areas in California that are near my house or that I've visited. The problem with both of these is that they don't provide topo maps with contour lines. Google maps does provide maps with hill shading, although IIRC they make it a hassle to print them, and you can't get features such as a UTM grid. There are some third parties that provide free topo maps in formats friendly to handheld devices, but I'm not aware of any that give global coverage. Here are some I know of, with links to a sample area in California so you can compare them. Stamen : shading but not contours Closed Contour : only covers the Sierra Toposm : US only If you just want color images of normal paper maps, then usually they can be obtained easily from national governments' web sites. Examples: US Topo Maps : There are more convenient and better designed third-party portals such as http://libremap.org . Topo maps with trails are available for some USFS lands from the Forest Service . UK Ordnance Survey Switzerland Maps : an extremely well designed site Mexico Topo Maps : theoretically allows you to download maps, but appears to be unusable In my experience, the most practical approach is to get maps on paper, either by buying them or by downloading images and printing them out on a color printer. This has the advantage that it's cheap or free, and there is coverage of pretty much everywhere that I want to go. You can get maps with UTM grids on them, or draw in UTM grids. The UTM grid makes it possible to use them with GPS. An added advantage of the paper maps is that if your GPS unit isn't working (dead batteries, no satellites visible in the sky because you're in a deep canyon, ...), you can still use them. Yet another advantage is that they provide much higher resolution than an LCD screen at any given scale.\",\n",

Our goal is to connect as many people as possible to the nature of Massachusetts. Our trails are extremely welcoming for all – whether you are an individual without a disability who is a beginner on our trails, or you have any sort of disability that may have kept you from the trail in the past, we aim to design these trails to be welcoming to the entire community. All 20 Mass Audubon sites with Nature Centers have Americans with Disabilities Act compliant parking, entrances, admission areas, educational activity spaces, exhibits, galleries, and restrooms. They each also offer at least one Accessible trail, which is mostly flat, and not too difficult for people with walking impairments. As of this writing, more than half have trails designed to accommodate people with disabilities at all levels, especially those who can see only partially or not at all. These are All-Person's Trails, or Universally Accessible Sensory Trails. These trails are designed and constructed first to physically meet or exceed Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance, and then to incorporate universally designed interpretive features including educational stops, wildlife viewing boardwalks and platforms, picnic and play areas, and navigation resources including audio directions, guide ropes, curbing, and handrails. Mass Audubon's Accessibility page gives details and pictures. This page lists the sanctuaries with Nature Centers, and the notation of those with these newer full-featured trails. At all of these equipped sanctuaries, the Nature Center provides everything you need. At the admission window, you can pick up trail information including a guide in printed or Braille format, and a printed or tactile (raised topographical) trail map. They have adaptive items available for loan, including hands-free binoculars (on a tripod), audio players, a walking cane with a small seat, and a push wheelchair. There are some basic criteria for All Person's Trails, so you can choose any location on the map that's marked as providing them. They're all over the state. All Person's Trails are typically 0.5-0.75 miles in length and include: Smooth, gentle grades for improved access by foot, stroller, or wheelchair Sensory-rich audio tours (available by cell phone and/or audio players) Braille texts and tactile maps Tour booklets and maps designed for high readability for visually impaired and sighted visitors Improved signage (also Braille) along trails Wider boardwalks with bumpers as needed Post-and-rope guiding systems. The guiding systems includes beads along the ropes. Round beads indicate the location of a narrated stop where you will find a sign within reach with the stop name and number in print and Braille. A square bead indicates that there is seating nearby. Interpretive content focusing on the natural and cultural history of each site Accessible outdoor wildlife observation structures, specialized gardens, seating, play areas, and picnic areas Here are a few examples of these trails, including the rope guide which blind people can use on their own: One great sanctuary is Drumlin Farm in a lovely town close to an hour west of Boston. While not visually-impaired, I do use a cane, walker or wheelchair, and have been very comfortable there. They have fun things for people of all ages. There are animals, farming, learning gardens, and a nature center. Daily hayrides from April through Thanksgiving include a fun, educational property tour. They have two loops on their All Person's Sensory Trail systems. This page has a full description of their accessibility options. There's also an audio tour feature, which has downloads of 8 stops on the Ice Pond Trail, which takes you closer to the water and woods; and 12 stops on the Farmyard Loop, which takes you closer to the animals. You can listen to it or download it. Ice Pond Trail: Ice Pond Trail is a woodland walk along the edge of a small pond, running from the parking lot to the admissions window at our Nature Center. This trail provides a quiet spot away from the busier sections of the farm. While the trail does meet ADA guidelines for grade and surfacing, you may find portions to be steep or strenuous. As with all outdoor trails, please watch your step, since surfaces may be wet or slippery at times depending on recent weather conditions. Distance: 350-foot accessible pathway Features: A five-foot wide crushed stone surface. A guide rope is provided along the entire Ice Pond trail, attached to the top of a fence. Round beads along the rope indicate the location of a narrated stop where you will find a sign within reach with the stop name and number in print and Braille. A square bead indicates that there is seating nearby. Farmyard Loop: This trail takes you from the main entrance at the Drumlin Farm Nature Center, past the wildlife exhibits and the many barns and animals of the farmyard, and back to the Nature Center. Visiting all eleven stops on the Farmyard Loop trail takes about 30 minutes, although you can easily spend one and a half to two hours enjoying the animals and natural habitats along the Farmyard Loop. The trail also includes several optional detours to the wilder areas of the sanctuary, some covering rougher ground, which you are welcome to explore if you choose to. Distance: 0.4 mile round trip trail Features: The surface is a combination of nine-foot wide paved walkway and hard-packed road. The path slopes downhill from the Nature Center between markers 8 and 10, with benches available for rest stops at the steepest sections. There is a picnic area after stop 17. Audio Tour: There is an audio tour for both segments of our accessible trail. You can access the audio tour three ways: You can call 781-443-7154 on your cell phone. This tour is available by phone April through December. You can download the Audio Tour from the website and play it on your personal audio player when you visit. You can borrow an audio player at the Nature Center admission window. I hope this gives your friends at least something to consider. Hopefully other people will offer more suggestions.\",\n",

       "    'body': 'Short Answer: In the US, laws regulating land use are detailed and varied, even on Public Lands. Check with the local land agency before \"roaming.\" Long Answer: Loosely you can divide open space in the US into two main categories: Private and Public. Private Land : The laws governing private land vary by state. In Texas, for example, a landowner is well within his rights to shoot trespassers that he \"reasonably feels\" are threatening him, or his property. (Known as the Castle Law - as in a Man\\'s Home is His Castle). Property lines becomes hazy with regards to river right-of ways (canoeing / kayaking) with some areas defining public right-of-way as the waterline, others as the flood-line. In general, as long as you stay in your boat, you should be able to pass through private land, but you might not be allowed to fish from their banks. Public Land : The rules concerning public land vary between agencies. State Parks, State Forests, National Parks, National Monuments, National Forests, BLM (Bureau of Land Management) Land, National Wildlife Refuges, National Grasslands... etc. Even Within each of these, there will be differences in what you are allowed to do. Wilderness , Primitive , Roadless are some of the different sub-sections you might find within a single National Forest, or National Park or BLM Land. Most regulations regard the usage of vehicles (where you can and can\\'t drive) and camping. But some rules apply to hiking as well. The most restrictive are usually National Parks and Monuments - which often have permit systems for overnight hiking, and designated camping areas. National Forests vary widely on whether you need a permit or not, especially concerning Wilderness areas, which might limit usage / group size to protect the resource. These might also include where you can camp (distance from bodies of water) whether you can have camp fires, etc... or even whether you need a permit. These regulations vary by National Forest. Generally, however, on non-Wilderness , National Forest or BLM land, you are free to travel on any established, marked road, and camp in any established dispersed camping area (ie, one already barren and obviously been used for camping). Limits on how long you are allowed to stay exist (usually 14 days). Conclusion: The US has an awesome system of public lands (quite possibly the country\\'s most redeeming property). However, the right to roam (or the regulation against) varies widely. Check with the local Public Land\\'s office when you arrive in an area to determine what is or is not allowed. (And why... Surprisingly, most of the rules are in place to help protect the resource from over-use, not to ruin your trip.) As for whether these rules are a \"bureaucratic formality\": No . Ignoring the regulations are a tickit-able misdemeanor that carries the same weight as a traffic violation, punishable by fines and jail time. In reality, most carry a modest fine, but failure to pay can result in your arrest. And, as is the case with all laws in the US - Ignorance of the law is no excuse for violating it.',\n",

Examples: Algonquin Provincial Park has its own set of maps and guidebooks for both hiking and canoeing. If you go to this park, you must check out those resources. They are quite extensive. I think other larger Provincial Parks in Canada also have \"Friends\" organizations. Allegheny National Forest has at least two hiking guide books with maps.

       "    'body': 'I\\'m not sure you can generalize US Hiking trails, since there will be vast variability in popularity, usage, land area, population density etc. (Just as you mentioned is the case in popular vs. remote areas of Europe). Yes, there are some areas that require reservations, but most don\\'t. In fact, I feel comfortable saying MOST federal public land in the western US have no quotas, no reservation system, no anything. In many of those, you won\\'t see another soul for days. Other areas might be equally unregulated and have wall-to-wall people. In the answers here: \" When do I need a permit to go into nature? \" I list some of the agencies that have different approaches to land management, and point out it varies so widely that any generalization is impossible. To answer this: \"Are quota set so that every hiker can have the opportunity to feel alone in the world, or so that hikers won\\'t completely overrun the national park and destroy it?\" Yes : Wilderness areas (congressionally designated Wilderness with a capital \"W\" -- see below) have a legal mandate to limit users so your encounter rates are small. How that is interpreted varies by the agency administering the area (some shoot for less than 2 groups encountered per day). By contrast, some popular areas of National Forests or Parks might limit usage based on the maximum visitation possible before total annihilation of the resource. Often, even within a National Park or Forest, there are different usage areas with different quotas, or no quota at all... ( See this information about Grand Canyon permits ) As for the philosophical underpinnings, the US has vast amounts of empty space, and lots of people would like to keep it that way. Above and beyond the Public Lands System (Parks, Forests, Seashores, Grasslands, Recreation Areas, etc) a far-minded group passed the Wilderness Act of 1964 to take land preservation to the N\\'th degree. This brilliant piece of legislation sets aside some areas in the US specifically for solitude: In order to assure that an increasing population, accompanied by expanding settlement and growing mechanization, does not occupy and modify all areas within the United States and its possessions, leaving no lands designated for preservation and protection in their natural condition, it is hereby declared to be the policy of the Congress to secure for the American people of present and future generations the benefits of an enduring resource of wilderness. This act -- a federal law passed by congress -- defines Wilderness as: A wilderness, in contrast with those areas where man and his own works dominate the landscape, is hereby recognized as an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain. An area of wilderness is further defined to mean in this Act an area of undeveloped Federal land retaining its primeval character and influence, without permanent improvements or human habitation, which is protected and managed so as to preserve its natural conditions and which (1) generally appears to have been affected primarily by the forces of nature, with the imprint of man\\'s work substantially unnoticeable; (2) has outstanding opportunities for solitude or a primitive and unconfined type of recreation; (3) has at least five thousand acres of land or is of sufficient size as to make practicable its preservation and use in an unimpaired condition; and (4) may also contain ecological, geological, or other features of scientific, educational, scenic, or historical value. [Full text here] This is an awesome legacy for the US. Not all public land is Wilderness, but significant chunks are, and these are some of the most amazing natural areas in the US.',\n",

       "    'body': 'Your requirements are conflicting. Think about it. It costs money to build showers and toilets and to provide running water. It\\'s quite unlikely that someone or some organization is going to build a campground with the amenities you want, then let everyone camp there for free, especially close to a major city where the demand will be high. Basically, you can probably camp for free, or you can camp with amenities, but not both. In the western US, the rules for camping in National Forests are often quite relaxed. Many Forests allow \"dispersed\" camping, which is free. That means you pull off to the side of a dirt road, and pitch your tent. There are no toilets or anything else, but it\\'s free. This tends to be in places that don\\'t get overrun as a result, so \"not too far\" from Los Angeles is less likely. Still, such camping is allowed in other places close to major cities, like in the Tonto NF less than one hour drive from downtown Phoenix. Find the National Forests in the area, and ask them specifically about camping restrictions. National Forests are also good places to camp in special-built campgrounds for relatively low cost compared to other designated-site campgrounds. State parks tend to cost more. However, this is just a rough guide. The general rules are just that, and they can be quite different near cities.',\n",

       "    'body': \"I can't speak for lands inside a city, but out in the woods the best way to hide a trail, is not to leave a trail . I grew up in the sticks where growing up everyone I knew had a secret fort somewhere in the dense forest, the thing to do with your buddies after school was to hang out at your secret fort; building it up, fortifying it, shooting BB guns, or scouting around trying to find someone else's fort to raid for nails and other building supplies (there was no hardware store in town to buy that kind of stuff). Trails were a dead give away, if you saw a small foot trail heading into the trees off of one of the many access trails, odds were good you'd find a tree fort at the end of it, the hardest forts to find were ones that didn't have an obvious trail leading to them. If you don't want people to find your secret spot, don't tread down a nice path to get there, access it from different directions, but don't damage the under growth. This was easy enough for us to do in the East Kootenays, because there's loads of deadfall in the woods, so we would just walk along the fallen trees and never touch the ground. The trick is to Leave no Trace as you move through the bush, you do this by not disturbing any of the growth and traveling on durable surfaces . No one is going to lecture you about picking up broken glass and maintaining a pretty spot in the woods. Picking up litter is a service, and everyone enjoys when things look more pretty. But I wouldn't leave anything behind though, dropping swings and furniture on someone else's land is littering, doesn't matter if it's nice comfortable litter or not. Bring a picnic blanket and a hammock in your bag instead.\",\n",

Unauthorized private modifications to public land can be a serious problem. Not only can you get into trouble doing it, it may make work and cause problems for those who are in charge.

When doing so, make it clear you are willing to help as a volunteer to perform any work. However, you should not take it upon yourself to make modifications to something that\\'s not yours without the proper permission. I can tell you for sure that if you came to my town and started modifying markings at trail intersections, we\\'d take a very dim view of that. If you came to the Trails Committee instead with a proposal, we\\'d kick it around and evaluate the idea with the benefit of the general public in mind. There may also be various restrictions and deals made about trails on that property that you are not aware of. Those may proclude a certain type of use, or even a certain type of signage. Yes, both of these restrictions, and a number of others, exist of various parts of our trail network. Added in response to comments Wow, we have a tough crowd here. The main objection seems to be that this answer doesn\\'t apply to the OP\\'s location. Maybe it doesn\\'t, but there is no way to know since the OP never mentioned a location. If you want a answer that is specific to a location, you need to specify that location in the question. I just checked, and the OP is in Bulgaria according to his profile. I don\\'t know what laws and customs are like in Bulgaria, and of course we don\\'t know if that\\'s where the OP is actually asking about either. In any case, this answer is still correct for significant parts of the world, including where I am, which is in the US, more specifically New England. Around here, even in a city, someone will own the land and have authority over it. While walking on it is generally OK as long as it\\'s not specifically posted \"No trespassing\", making any modifications without permission of the land owner is not OK. This would include trimming branches to make a trail, or to deliberately obfuscate a existing trail. It would absolutely include putting up a swing and installing benches. To take this even further, in some cases modifications, even just clearing a trail, may take more permission than just the land owner\\'s consent. There can be various ordinances in a city governing vacant property. Here in Massachusetts anything within 100 feet of a wetland requires permission from the local Conservation Commission in addition to consent from the land owner. So all those quick to downvote because they assume it doesn\\'t apply to the OP\\'s particular sitation need to consider that it does apply to many such situations in many parts of the world. I don\\'t really care whether this answer ultimately helps the OP or not. However, it is something anyone else contemplating something similar should consider carefully since it may apply to them. Downvote as you see fit, but I\\'m leaving this here because it is in line with the Stack Exchange stated goal of building broad and long-lasting repository of questions and answers.',\n",

There are also the municipal campsites that are run by the local town. http://www.camping-municipal.org/ardeche-camping-municipal.htm .

       "    'body': 'Access to climbing areas is an ongoing issue in many climbing areas. In the United States for example, it is claimed that 1 in 5 climbing areas is threatened by an access issue. There are many funds , societies , and advocacy groups who work on behalf of climbers to protect public access to climbing areas, to keep them open to the public for recreational climbing. Try searching for an access group that works in your area. The issue of access is not always so simple, as there can be multiple factors to consider when it comes to certain crags. Around where I\\'m from, there\\'s pretty much open access to everything , because most of the climbing areas are on crown land. There are however a lot of cliffs and boulders that are on private land, and private land owners have the right to prohibit trespassing on their property. The biggest concern with climbing on private property in some countries is liability. In North America for example, If someone gets hurt climbing a private crag, then the landowner is legally liable, and can be sued. Most land owners prefer to restrict access to their lands instead of risking the possibility of even one lawsuit. Local authorities are especially likely to restrict climbing on municipally owned lands, because they are regularly subject to a plethora of ridiculous claims (people frequently sue towns and cities because they can\\'t be bothered to be accountable for tripping over their own feet on the sidewalks, and hurting themselves). In the USA this is especially common because in many cases suing is the only option an injured person has for paying their hospital bills. One sensitive issue with a lot of climbing areas is the presence of native art on the rocks. I know of several areas nearby that are prime climbing areas, but climbing there is somewhat controversial because it can do damage to the ancient art on the stone. Access to areas where native art is present is often restricted, and it just so happens that in most places where native art is preserved on stone, the rock is prime for climbing. If climbing has been banned at your crag \"for safety reasons\" then it sounds like a local authority issue, in which case your best chance of restoring access is to partner with a access group, and petition the local authority. If you can show the authority that an area can be responsibly climbed, then they may work with you to open access to climbing. Talk to the CAO or City Manager about presenting to your council, that should always be your first course of action when seeking change in a policy in a municipality. As far as preventing access issues, what you need to do is demonstrate that the area is being used responsibly. Leave No Trace ethics will ensure that no flags are raised about improper use of an area. I\\'ve seen crags full of garbage and covered with graffiti. There\\'s a now-popular climbing area close to where I live that used to be closed to climbing. The Town of Frank in Alberta used to prohibit people from climbing on the millions of boulders which were the result of the worlds largest rock avalanche, that buried most of the Town early in the 20th century. I remember when signs used to be posted on the side of the road telling you that climbing on the rocks was prohibited. Today it\\'s a renowned bouldering area with thousands of established problems, with more new problems being established almost weekly. Access was granted after it became clear to the municipality that bouldering was a huge tourist attraction, and promoting the area attracts a lot of tourism and benefits local businesses.

Take more time and go deeper One report on Jasper Park said that of all visitors that got out of their car other than for a ski-resort never got more than a mile from their car. There are only a scattering of trails in Jasper that have much use that are more than 10 km from the trail head. (The Skyline trail is a notable one.) My experience with Willmore Wilderness (Just north of Jasper) is that 90+ percent of all encounters have been within 15 km of the Rock Lake trailhead. Time shift your day. By default people get up travel to the trailhead, and start their walk. This means starting mid morning for a nearby location. If you arrive at the trailhead at first light you're several hours ahead of the Rush Hour. I did the opposite, and due to various delays arrived at the trail head at 3 p.m. We met one party coming out, and saw one party fetching water from a stream for their camp. Time shift your trip. Depending on what you do, you may be able to score points by working on the holiday, and taking time off in lieu during the following week. This works particularly well for ski resorts, as midweek lines are a fraction of what weekend lines are. Space shift your trip. Example: In Alberta Calgary and Edmonton have different weeks off for spring break. Since many families time their winter holidays for this, it results in overcrowding nearby vacation spots. However, an Edmonton family willing to travel a bit further can hit one of the Calgary popular sites during a time when Calgary is still in school. Example: Some holidays are different in Canada vs the U.S. Canada has the August long weekend. Our Thanksgiving is the 2nd Monday in October; You have Memorial Day, We have Queen Victoria's Birthday a week or two earlier. You have the 4th of July. We have Canada day on the 1st of July. If you live near the border you may be able to take advantage of this. Take advantage of the off seasons. Depending how tough you are/how well equipped you are many places have an off season.

While my activities can sometimes bring me to cross some private land, I am only passing through on foot and there will be no trace of my presence. Using motor vehicles, cutting wood, gathering edibles is never a good idea. On public land, there are different options. My experience is in the province of Quebec where in all provincial parks, the activities you describe are prohibited. In faunal reserves, where the main goal is hunting and fishing, outside of hunting season, pretty much everything can be done as long as you are not spending the night. There is usually logging activities anyway so conservation isn't a big concern. Logging patches are great spots to gather berries. Then there is public land without specific statutes. Those are pretty much open game. Unless you are going across the 4000sq. meters of someone's lease, it's open to the public, but from what I understand, it has to be a temporary use. Public land that's not a park or reserve of some sort is not easy to find close to large urban centers. For example, in Quebec, there is almost none south of St-Laurent river. North, it's usually 2h away, or more. Last weekend, I drove 1300km north close to the 52nd parallel and the destination was still a nature reserve with strict regulations. My best advice is to look for legislation specific to the province you are moving to and stay away from private land. Here's a map of public land VS private land in Quebec. You'll notice it's all very heterogenous. Light blue is public, beige is private. There is also the question of aboriginal rights. First Nations have rights that supersede other citizen's.

State forests in the east are not as intensively managed, advertised, or visited as state parks. State forests are not quite wilderness in that they are usually managed based on human-defined priorities, be it sustainable timber production, wildlife, recreation, unique areas, or some combination. The wildlife and timber production areas are generally the least obviously tread by humans and the most friendly to your own activities (i.e. you can camp there, following certain rules and conditions). There are also areas designated as different degrees of wilderness such as in the Adirondack Park . You can use those designations and maps to seek out the more wild areas. It could also be worth looking up recreational stats for different areas, as some wilderness areas (e.g. Adirondack High Peaks) are far more visited than some state forest recreation areas. If in doubt, ask the local environmental agency about location recommendations and what the rules are with camping. In NY, most state forest can be camped on as long as you follow some rules and aren't in specially designated unique areas.

There are several things to keep in mind when making comparisons like this: As far as the US are concerned, you are talking about the most popular national parks here: places like Yosemite, Yellowstone and Zion get few millions of visitors each year, from all over the world. At the same time, there are huge stretches of beautiful wilderness, often right next to these parks, where you can hike for days without meeting anybody. In the US, there are still large stretches of land that are very well preserved, where the nature is pretty much undisturbed. These areas indeed are pretty sensitive, a large influx of visitors in these places can cause a lot of damage. In Europe, lot of the area had been very densely populated for quite a while, and most of the land has been in some sort of use for a long time. At places like that, large crowds will not really cause that much damage. Western Europe has only few very small areas that still have fairly undisturbed original wilderness, and many of those cannot be entered without a special permit that is only available to those that have some sort of business there (researchers, forest service etc.), and the public is not allowed in at all. Because these areas are so small and there is so few of them, lot of people are not even aware that these exist. Probably because it is so densely populated, lot of Europe has numerous hiking opportunities on what's basically agricultural land: fields, pastures, agricultural forests. There are lot of hiking trails that go through agricultural land, simply because there are so few other options. In US, most agricultural land is private, and closed to public. You can only hike on state or federal lands, and in many regions these are sparse, so they get a lot of exposure, and therefore need to be protected. In Eastern Europe, there are number of areas that are still pristine, and relatively unregulated, but I believe that is going to change. Some 30 years ago, Romanian Fagarash was a place you could backpack for several weeks without meeting a single person. I have not been there lately, but what I hear from friends is that the place is becoming rather crowded, and, correspondingly, quite damaged.

All National Parks are run by the National Park Service (NPS), part of the US Department of the Interior. Creation of new national parks is done through an act of congress. Creation of a new park using land administered by a different dept, such as a National Forest which is managed by the Dept of Agriculture, would also require congressional action to reassign that section of land. National Monuments on the other hand, can be created on any federally owned land, through presidential authority alone. Congress can create monuments as well, but authority is not exclusive to them as is for NPS. Additionally, management of a National Monument can be done by whatever agency is appropriate. Many National Monuments are run and managed by the NPS, but not all. Some are maintaind by the US Forest Service, some by the BLM, one by the Dept of Energy, one by the Air Force and others. Whereas without exception all National Parks must be managed by the NPS. Apart from that, there is really no significant necessary difference, as whether a given place feels like a park, museum, or something else will depend more on what the protected area contains rather than who's running it. Being a park does have a somewhat narrower criteria than national monuments, but you'll see more variation within the two groups than between.\",\n",

       "    'body': \"Living in Utah in the US I have a somewhat unique perspective (Utah has more national parks then any other state) I have visited all of the national parks here and most throughout the west. As others have mentioned if you compare the amount of reservations and restrictions to the amount of space the ratio is actually quite small. I thought I would answer though to give more specific examples. You mentioned Yosemite (beautiful by the way highly recommend), there is a 'Rim' trail there that leads to one of the biggest waterfalls (and biggest attractions) in the park. However the trail was set up in such a way that most (if not all) visitors hike for a mile or so to hit the falls, which means there are hundreds (sometimes thousands) of people there at any one time. For those that really enjoy hiking, you can hike in along the rim, a very strenuousness 10 mile hike with lots of steep grades. Your destination is the same, and at the end you will run into the hundreds of people. But along the way you will see a dozen waterfall's everyone else won't see and for hours you won't run into a single other person. That's one specific example but from my experience many very popular hiking destinations in US National parks are set up in this same manner. They allow the masses to see the really spectacular, while limiting the exposure of the land to those masses. And at the same time allow those who really want to, to experience both the spectacular, and the beauty/isolation of real wilderness area. Finally an example of something mentioned above, many restrictions have to do with managing emergency situations. My favorite hike in Zion's national park is very hard to get into. It requires a back-country pass and they are often reserved a year in advance. But I would never think of going into the hike without a pass. Not only would I be fined a huge penalty if caught, but I have been on the hike when a storm hits (the hike involves 8 miles of hiking in a slot canyon) and barely made it out. The last group of the day wasn't so lucky and they got trapped on the hike overnight (actually they were very lucky they didn't all die, the flash floods were horrible). If people had been in there illegally, most likely they would have died, as is, because of the limits, the rangers knew who to look for and where, and were able to manage the situation and get everyone out alive.\",\n",

This is the result of internet searching in the Fall of 2016. Nothing is static, parks are subject to full or partial closure due to weather or planned major constructions projects. No attempt is made in this answer, to identify closures that are not permanent. If a major event (disaster or construction project) alters the permanent state of a park readers are encouraged to update the answer, while keeping the same optimal site parameters. Modifications in your “optimal” site can greatly impact the potential available solutions. Of the 47 parks, many do not offer RV camping with electrical hookups (circa 2017), but do have nearby state parks with hookups, these are used as the secondary optimal site location. Commercial sites with full hook-ups can usually be found in the area. Most National parks allow some form of backcountry camping. The addition of a generator or solar panel(s) to your RV that eliminate a need for electrical hookups can greatly expand the available options. Most self-contained RVs will have sufficient battery and fuel (propane) storage to allow for a couple of days camping without any hookups. Many of the National and State parks have limits on vehicle length. You will need to know the actual length of you RV, tow vehicle and combined length, when choosing campgrounds and/or specific sites. Use a tape measure to find the actual length of your equipment. Legend Park = name of the park State = name of the State(s) the national park is located in Region = general area of the country the park is located in Link to National Park Service = main park page at nps.gov Link to NPS camping = camping page at nps.gov Link to Wikipedia = main park page at en.wikipedia.org Link to Weather = one of potentially several park specific sites for the monthly weather at weather.com at the time these links where selected they also displayed a graph indicating the average temperature range of the park for each month of the year. I transferred these values to a table and used the table plan the visit schedule. Optimal temperature range for visiting the park is a low of 32 F or above, and high of 89 F or below. RV Camping in the Park = lists the name of a campground in the park with electrical RV hookups (optimal) and or provides important information about RV camping in the park. “Other for amenities” Means RV camping is allowed in the park, but without hookups. Length rules are NOT addressed here. Reserve = this is my attempt to identify the most likely place I would choose to make reservations for a visit. Information here is going to be the most subject to deterioration over time and subject to opinion. Attempting this journey without reservations would be disappointing at best, impossible at worst. In some cases, reservations are required for even the most difficult to access non-RV sites. With variations by park, ranging from drop in the office the day before, to schedule online 2 days, 2 months, or anything up to a year in advance. While it gives a starting point, significant effort by the trip planner will be required in this area. Primitive Camping Options = A brief review of camping options in the park, other than an RV site with hookups. Any of four general options are given Hike, Boat, Drive, Horse Hike = Generally termed “backcountry camping”, you walk some distance (rules vary by park) carrying all of your gear (and maybe water) to spend the night. Options range from designed sites that require reservations, to sleep anywhere out the wilderness. At the least usually requires a free pass be obtained from the ranger station that day. Boat = Anything from class V white water, to ocean going boating. Generally, either personal boats or rental options exist, “backcountry camping” access by boat. Drive = Drive to a designated site without RV hookups, RVs may or may NOT be permitted. A numbered site in a designated campground, minimum is generally parking for one vehicle, a picnic table, fire pit, and room for a tent. Drinking water may or may NOT be available in the campground, at least a pit toilet is available, some may have flush toilets and showers with hot water.

       "    'body': \"It depends on the kind of camping you want to do. The easiest type of camping to find is camping at a campground. Usually this involves paying a nightly fee (often around $20-30 per night) for a numbered, designated campsite. Usually the campsite comes with a fire pit and/or grill, a picnic table, a parking spot, and space to pitch a tent. Most campgrounds also have shared bathroom facilities including flush toilets and showers. Campgrounds can be found at many National Forests, National Parks, State Parks, and State Forests. They are easy to find through the website for that park. Commercial campgrounds are also common in some areas. The other type of camping is primitive, backwoods, backcountry and/or dispersed camping. You may need a permit; be sure to review the specific rules and restrictions for the area. This type of camping is most common in national forests. It's available in some national parks as well, but with much tighter restrictions. The terms are used somewhat interchangeably, but here's a general breakdown: Primitive or backwoods camping means there are no amenities. Dig your own pit toilet and fire pit (and fill it in afterwards). Fires may or may not be allowed. Dispersed backwoods camping means you can camp anywhere in the designated area. There are always some site-specific exceptions, like a setback distance from streams. Backwoods camping at designated sites means there are specific camp spots (usually each spot is named or numbered). If fires are allowed in that area, there will often be a metal fire ring or stone-lined fire pit. Here's a list of national parks, national forests, and state parks in the southeast US that have beaches and camping. I didn't actually look into the fishing options, but many of these will have fishing. I assumed you wanted an ocean beach with saltwater fishing. If you're interested in inland fishing on a river or lake, your options are even more numerous. National Forests - Visit their website and interactive forest locator map . Camping information is available on the page for each specific forest. The website makes it difficult to figure out where dispersed camping is actually allowed, so I recommend calling the local ranger station for information (email if you must, but they're usually extremely helpful over the phone). Finding information about national forests is usually more difficult than for national parks, but if you're looking for a remote, isolated wilderness experience, dispersed camping in a national forest is the way to go.

The National Park system exists to protect the most exceptionally beautiful landscapes in the US. If you're looking for natural beauty, you can't beat a National Park. These parks typically have more visitors and tighter restrictions than National Forests. National Parks in Florida that allow camping and have a beach: Gulf Islands National Seashore - this park has campgrounds as well as dispersed backcountry camping in designated areas. Boat-in camping is allowed in many parts of this park. Everglades National Park - this park has two campgrounds and some designated backcountry campsites (no dispersed camping) Dry Tortugas National Park - primitive camping only; this park is accessible only by a daily ferry, or by hiring a boat or seaplane Big Cypress National Preserve - this park has 8 campgrounds as well as a huge expanse of backcountry where you can backcountry camp with a permit National Parks in Georgia that allow camping and have a beach: Cumberland Island National Seashore National Parks in South Carolina that allow camping and have a beach: Congaree National Park National Parks in North Carolina that allow camping and have a beach: Cape Hattaras National Seashore - four campgrounds, no dispersed or backcountry camping Cape Lookout - Primitive camping on the beach. Fires are allowed on the beach below the high tide line. State Parks are managed by the individual state goverment and can be extremely variable in quality and type. The worst state parks can be a boring mowed field with a few unshaded campsites and a manmade fishing pond. The best state parks have extraordinarily beautiful natural landscapes comparable to National Parks, but are less crowded. As long as you do your research, you can have a great experience with a state park. Camping in Florida State Parks Camping in Georgia State Parks Camping in South Carolina State Parks Camping in North Carolina State Parks You need a state-issued fishing license to fish in the United States. (Even if you're just dangling your line in the water and not planning on catching anything.) Fishing licenses are issued by the department of natural resources in each state. Each state has its own separate government, so the regulations are different in each state. If you want to go fishing in multiple states, you'll need a fishing license for each state. Here are the current prices (as of November 21, 2019) and links to purchase fishing licenses in some of the southeastern states.

Some areas will have other restrictions, like permit requirements for overnight trips or seasonal fire restrictions. Most are tens of thousands of acres, which is plenty big enough to get out of hearing range of other humans for as long as your supplies hold out. To camp in these for weeks, look up the local land management office in charge of them and give them a call to learn about access, current conditions and restrictions. They'll know what access points are accessible, what ones are washed out, and which areas you can visit to have the least chance of being seen. The relevant agency can be the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), US Forest Service, or the National Park Service. You'll want the local office, not one in DC. There's a list at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._Wilderness_Areas . In addition, in the western US, there are huge tracts of unprotected, undeveloped government owned land managed by the BLM that would fit your needs perfectly, but the best places are harder to find through internet searches. If you get to know local outdoorsmen and women, they can give you better direction for specific places that would suit your needs.\",\n",

I'm pretty sure there is a web site about trail conditions, but for the White Mountains of New Hampshire you can get trail conditions info directly at the Pinkham Notch visitor center run by the AMC, the National Forest visitor center in Lincoln, and probably various places you can call including the several you could walk into to ask. Every major park or forest has some place you can call or look on the web. For more obscure places (hiking-wise), it gets less formal. Here in north-central Massachusetts, like in much of the US northeast away from the major hiking destinations, there is a surprisingly large scattering of land open to the public with trails on it. There is no one place to go for info about all of them. Most of these areas are just patches of land with maybe a sign and hopefully a few blazes on the trails. There is no visitor center or any building or any staff, so there is nobody you can call directly and there isn't likely a web site with up to date conditions. For the obscure local trails, you have to use a little common sense. For example, if you wanted to explore the Harry J Rich State Forest in Groton, which is unstaffed with no facilities, you use a little logic and realize it's conditions aren't going to be that different from a few miles away. For example, you might inquire about the Willard Brook State Park in Townsend. Conditions will be similar enough, and someone there may have even recently been out to the Rich Forest. Or find out about conditions in the town. Lots of towns have conservation groups with web sites. These don't generally list current conditions since that would be too much work for the volunteers to keep up with. But, there is usually some contact info. To use Groton as the example again, there is the Groton Conservation Commission, the Groton Trails committee, the private Groton Conservation Trust, each with web pages. It doesn't take much digging to find a email address or find that there is a grotontrails email list. Send a message saying you're from out of town and would like to know the conditions, and you'll probably have half a dozen replies by the end of the day. If you want to hike in Littleton or Ayer or Westford instead, dig around there for web sites and contact information. For example, Littleton has the Littleton Conservation Trust private group, and the headquarters for the New England Forestry Foundation are located there. If you can't find anything for Ayer, for example, look at a map and realize that whatever you find out about Littleton or Groton will be pretty close. These are just local examples that I am familiar with since I live and work here, but this sort of small local patchwork of organizations applies to most of New England, and probably to many other places too. So the answer for less known places is to dig around for local info and be willing to extrapolate to the place you are actually interested in.\",\n",

The best approach would be to leave the park as undisturbed as possible, and especially where other people might see it and be bothered by it.

Your modifications should not be spotted from the water or the trail, and thus be less likely to offend any other visitor, whether a ranger or a member of the public. Use natural materials.

       "    'body': 'No, a \"national forest\" here in the US is a legal designation and does not mean the land is actually covered with trees (a forest). In the US, there are quite a number of governmental divisions that own and manage land that is open to the public to various degrees. Sticking just to the larger federal ones, there is BLM land (Bureau of Land Management), department of the interior which runs the national parks and monuments, the department of agriculture which runs the national forests, and a few more I don\\'t remember details of. For example, I don\\'t remember who exactly is responsible for national wildlife refuges, but is that yet another agency (within DoI, I think). Some other agencies have land that is partly open to the public in some cases more as a aside, like the military. Generally military reservations are not open, but there are some strange deals like the Kofa National Wildlife refuge in AZ that is was actually carved out of the Yuma Proving Grounds, with a deal that the military can take it over again at any time in case of national need. It might require only a presidential edict or possibly even less, versus the act of congress it would take to otherwise move land around between agencies. Each of these agencies is tasked with different objectives, so they therefore run their lands differently. National parks and monuments (the only difference between the two is that a park is established by congress and a monument by presidential edict, which is sometimes then ratified by congress and converted to a park) are run by the Department of the Interior and are primarily for conservation with some mandate for public access, recreation, and education. National forests on the other hand are run by the Department of Agriculture, and quite a variety of benefits are expected from them, many of them conflicting. The national forests are looked at more as nationally owned resources. The DoA likes to refer to them as \"land of many uses\", which you often see on the road signs. Much of the nation\\'s timber harvest comes from the National Forests. Sections are routinely auctioned for harvest. The forest service must plan these on a long term sustainable basis, but providing forest products is a primary job of a National Forest. More broadly, National Forests are really lands held as a public resource. The name came from when these were first established as the federal government bought up lands the timber companies clear cut and dumped, so they were originally forests. Since then, the same governmental infrastructure was used to hold other public lands regardless of vegetation cover. The common theme to all National Forests is land held as a public resource, not necessarily just conservation, although there is a mandate that any uses be long term sustainable. The National Forests do include a lot of true forest, but also tundra, desert, and various other landscape types. But wait, then there are the federal Wildernesses. These are well explained in a answer by LBell . The Wilderness designation runs accross agencies. Any federal agency that holds land can have a wilderness area on that land if it meets the various criteria. There are Wilderness areas in National Parks and Monuments, in National Forests, and on BLM land. These are basically pure conservation areas, and are even more protected than just a National Park. Here are some examples: This is in the White Mountain National Forest in NH looking south from Zealand Notch in the fall. This area really is a forest, as with most of the eastern US when the land is left to its own. This is in the same \"Forest\", but this section is above tree line. To the right of the ridge is the Pemigawasset Wilderness, which is a region within the White Mountain National Forest. Here is land in a totally different climate with totally different plant cover. This is in the Tonto National Forest of AZ north of Phoenix. Here the name \"Forest\" is purely the legal designation.',\n",

       "    'body': \"This answer assumes that either land ownership is not an issue, or that you have permission from the owner. Please read Olin Lanthrop's answer for a discussion of the ethical issues of whether you SHOULD do this. A lot of the details of trail obfuscation depend on the local ecosystem. For instance, a general rule is to put branches in front of the trail head, to block it and obscure it. This is very effective in dense woodland, and moderately effective in sparse woodland or dense grasslands, where fallen branches are reasonably common. In a barren area, it simply calls attention to the trailhead, and a new entrance will quickly appear beside the original entrance. In a rocky area, placing small boulders at the trailhead may help hide it. Soil compaction is the main thing that distinguishes a trail from the surrounding land. The tramped down soil makes it harder for seeds to take root, as well as providing the ground with a distinctive appearance. If you loosen the first few inches of soil with a rock rake or other tool, it will only take a few months or years for the land to look more like the surrounding area without any interference. To speed this up, you can plant some of the fast growing plants (weeds, probably) common to the park. Disguise the ground cover: If the land around the trailhead is loose-fallen leaves, rake some of the leaves over the trail. If it's all dead grass, lay some dead grass on it, and be prepared to replace it as it blows away. Loosening the soil also changes the appearance significantly, but it gets tramped down very easily. In this case, what I would do would be to scatter some mid-size branches along the first 2-4 meters of the trail, and rake some of the surrounding land cover over the trail for the same distance. This provides immediate cover. If the trail is wide enough to be narrowed, rake the ground cover a few inches deep to allow plants to grow easily, and toss out some seeds for common, fast-growing plants that are already in the lot. It will take very little use to compact the soil again, so the last step may not be worth the trouble on a trail you'll be using frequently.\",\n",

It is very unlikely you will be able to tell a barely used human made trail from a game trail. Hikers like to be very obvious about the trails they make, and established trails are well worn. If a trail is very narrow, has undisturbed or barely disturbed ground cover, and is a bit overgrown, it's likely to be a game trail. Look at the ground cover. If it looks identical to the surrounding ground, it's more likely a game trail. Look for upturned or heavily compressed leaves (relative to the surrounding ground cover) and footprints. These are signs of human use, although the leaf disturbances might also come from animal use. Animals will use human made trails, so hoofprints don't tell you much either way. If you are somewhere without leaves, just compare the ground surface to the surrounding area. The bigger the differences, the more likely it is to be a human trail. Look at the vegetation up top. If you see broken branches, especially from waist to eye height, it might be human activity. If you don't see broken branches, but there are none to snag your clothes or poke you in the eye, it usually means a person removed them. Look for litter. This is a sure sign of human use. Keep in mind that the trail might just lead to a party spot for locals. Additionally, game trails that do look like human trails usually revert to typical game trails in a hundred feet or so at most. So if you start following it, then realize it's getting harder to follow, it's probably a game trail.\",\n",

Most trails have evolved from usage patterns before anyone went out to deliberately make a trail. Trails that are deliberately designed as trails are the results of lots of tradeoffs. There are many criteria that go into deciding where exactly to route a trail. Some are: Access to points of interest. Limit the slope. People generally don't like steep trails. They are also more difficult to maintain. If you are designing a handicapped-accessible trail, then you have to be careful about maximum grade (among many other things). Ease of cutting the trail. Ease of maintaining the trail. Trying not to create erosion. You really don't want a trail going straight up a slope, even if the magnitude of the slope is acceptable. Use will make a rut. Then water will run down the rut making a bigger rut. In the end you created a new streambed, not a trail. Then people walk along the sides, making a even bigger mess. To avoid particularly sensitive ecological areas. To keep things like nearby houses out of sight of the trail users. Because conservation restrictions, deed restrictions, requirements of the land donor, or various other legal restrictions don't give you much choice. You (or the organization you are designing the trail for) only owns a narrow corridor.

Hacking your own trails in a National Park is a really bad idea, not to mention a federal offense that will have consequences. If you really think there should be a new trail somewhere in a National Park, you very humbly propose it to park management. Most likely they won't be interested. If you do actually convince them, it will be a process. They will have standards that new trails must adhere to, various policies and procedures that must be followed, etc. They will certainly want to choose the route. You might be able to help or have influence over that process, probably depending on what they think of you. They will most likely want to do the construction with their own trail crews.

They all require a hike to get there, and they must be reserved well in advance before they fill up. This area takes its reservations (and other rules) seriously, so I wouldn't try to wing it.

Falling trees and rock slides are a hazard, as the fire will also burn the top layer of hummus, which make the ground vulnerable to erosion. In the case of a National park, there are other considerations other than the safety of people entering the park. As the natural growth recovers, the soil is vulnerable to invasive species. Patrons entering the park with dirty boots could introduce an invasive plant that could completely take over the whole park, so controlling the regrowth, and giving it an opportunity to do so uninterrupted is beneficial. There is at least one other reason the park officials have kept the park closed as long as they have as well: Archaeology. Burning off the top layer of soil apparently makes it much easier to find ancient Indian artifacts! Artifacts such as arrow heads and glass beads are being found all over the burnt areas of the park just laying on the ground. Archaeologists have been sifting through the ashes gathering up as many as they can find, and they have been able to identify hundreds of ancient camp sites.',\n",

Make sure you don\\'t accidentally remove \"brushed in\" trail entrances. That is where brush was deliberately piled so that a trail is not used, hopefully eventually reverting to just woods again. If you\\'re on anything with clearly deliberate blazes, you\\'re safe. For anything more than clearing debris without tools, you need to ask the owner or administrating agency. Public agencies usually have rules that they don\\'t want any unauthorized trail work. This is just to make sure they don\\'t get morons doing stupid things and to avoid liability. If you get to know the manager, forester, committee, or whatever that oversees a particularly area and they get to know and trust you, you usually end up with a informal arrangement where they trust you doing trail work without asking first and without them formally giving permission. Some groups can be real control freaks and don\\'t want anyone, even those that clearly know what they are doing, doing trail work without 3 levels of approval. I know one organization that takes this to the extreme. They have a \"steward\" assigned to each property, and then a few master stewards for groups of properties. Even though I actually built some of their trails, I can\\'t go out there when I have a spare hour and clean up a trail without prior approval. I don\\'t feel I should work that hard to give away my time for free, so I find a different place to do trail work. There are plenty of places run by other groups or organizations that are happy to have me help. I\\'m on the trails committee in my town, so I am actually authorized to go out with a chain saw and clean up a mess on any of the town land whenever I see a need. However, we don\\'t want people going so far as using a chain saw without talking to us first, but even then there are certain individuals and groups we know aren\\'t going to make a mess and nobody is going to make a fuss about one of them going out and clearing a major blow-down. But, we\\'re not going to tell you that if you come and ask as a individual, especially if we don\\'t know you. A good way to get known is to volunteer for organized trail work. I don\\'t know how other towns work but we probably have 1-3 formally organized events a month except when the snow it too deep to do much useful. After you show up a few times, the organizers will recognize you and you\\'ll be trusted a lot more. You might even mention a particular trail you think needs some work and offer to take care of it over the next week or two. Once you\\'re known, you\\'ll probably get a quiet unofficial nod and it works out for everyone. Added: A good example illustrating the issues envolved came up last night at the town Trails Committe (of which I am a appointed member) meeting. We learned that someone or some group has gone out to several trails with a leaf blower and \"cleaned\" them off down to bare ground. We\\'re pretty sure it was the local mountain bikers club, or at least individuals from there. We have a generally good relationship with the mountain bikers, and they show up regularly to help out with scheduled official trail work. We don\\'t really want to get in anyone\\'s face about this, but would rather the leaf blowing wasn\\'t happening, at least not without prior approval. The problem is that this promotes erosion, and also gives the trail a unnatural and less wilderness feel. We also really don\\'t like anyone working on trails with powered tools without coordinating with us first. It\\'s too soon to tell how this will be resolved. Some polite off the record conversations will be had with those envolved, and that will probably resolve this issue. This is a small town, we pretty much know who is doing what, and we also understand they probably thought they were improving things. Mountain bikers don\\'t like downed leaves because they can be slippery and cover up hazards. In any case, this illustrates some of the problems you may create for other people when doing what you think is helpful trail work. I\\'d say catagorically to never go so far as using powered tools (chainsaw, weed whacker, brush mower, leaf blower, etc) without getting the proper permission first. Picking up trail debris and even pruning back small overhanging limbs with a hand clipper would be OK in most cases. Everything in between is a gray area where you should first at least know who the owners or managers are, what rules there might be, etc.',\n",

I am in the northeastern U.S. and can tell you that most people already own the equipment to hike many of the most difficult all-day mountain trails in my region. You\\'re not even planning to stay overnight. Stage 1: Short, Flat Walks How far do you walk already? For starters, don\\'t do anything too different. Go to the local city or state park and walk the fraction-of-a-mile boardwalk or paved trail. You could probably do this today. Bring a bottle of water or another kind of drink if it\\'s hot. The type of container you store the water in isn\\'t important, as long as it\\'s light enough for you to carry. Wear sunscreen or a hat if it\\'s sunny. Otherwise, wear whatever clothes you find comfortable, and whatever shoes you\\'d choose if you didn\\'t care how you looked and wanted to walk from one end of your indoor shopping mall to the other. On an even paved trail for a fraction of a mile, you\\'d be OK even if your favorite walking shoes are flip-flops or high heels. If you want to learn more about what you\\'re seeing, read a book about the local nature. I find it enhances the experience. :) Stage 2: A Bit More Rugged Congratulations. If you\\'re having fun on the easiest hikes and want something more challenging, you\\'re ready to do what I would consider serious hiking. A 1-2 mile trail through the heart of a state or national park, possibly on rough and rocky terrain, can really make you feel far away from civilization. Make sure you bring plenty of water and wear sturdy shoes. Sneakers or any kind of sturdy flats are a good choice, and hiking boots are also okay. You might want to wade through streams or into lakes, and choosing stable trekking sandals as your footwear can make that fun. But don\\'t drink the water without purifying it first. Do NOT wear: Shoes that stretch or wobble. Examples: Flip-flops, leather sandals, Crocs, most dress shoes. On rough trails, these increase the risk of ankle injury. You also want to think twice where you put your feet when the trail is rough, and resist the urge to rush downhill. Uphill or downhill, keep a steady pace on rocky trails. To be on the safe side, you\\'d want to hike with a partner starting at this level. Any type of physical activity incurs a small risk of injury, and you don\\'t want to be alone in a remote area if you\\'re in trouble. You would also want to be familiar with the trail markers, and make sure you can clearly see the markers or the trail at all times. (On some trails this is a challenge...) Stage 3: Moderate Day Hiking 3-6 mile trails can lead you through several different habitats, around lakes, or up small mountains. At this level, you can start to really know the hikes in a major state or national park. Make sure you\\'re in reasonably good physical shape before you attempt a hike of this difficulty. You should be very comfortable doing the easy trails. These harder hikes will take several hours, so you should wear shoes that won\\'t give you blisters. Bring meals or snack food (such as gorp) as appropriate. You may also want to bring a flashlight, in case you miscalculate the time and find yourself stuck on the trail after dark. If you think the weather might change, bring or wear layers of clothes. Stage 4: Are You Going to Follow the Call of the Wild? If you\\'re comfortable with the easy and moderate hikes, you\\'re ready to leave your old life behind and spend a full day immersed in a trail. You probably want to wear some of the sturdiest shoes you own - sneakers or hiking boots, so long as they don\\'t give you blisters.

Vermont\\'s the other.\" http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/robert_frost/poems/733 He wrote this for a reason. You can take one of his (and my) favorite trails. It\\'s unforgettable. http://www.hikenewengland.com/FranconiaRidge081011.html If you hike the whole loop, you will ascend above the Northwoods and reach tundra and spectacular views. New Hampshire isn\\'t quite as rugged as Jack London\\'s The Call of the Wild , which is set even farther north. Still, its motto is \"Live Free or Die\" and despite its small size, it would mess with Texas. Perhaps you will be asking the question \"Hiking: How to stop?\" Don\\'t.',\n",

       "    'body': 'In the US, the designation National Monument or National Park (same thing other than the first created by presidential edict and the second by congress), sets preservation as one of the top goals. The intent is land that is largely to be left alone, and not harvested for various resources. Forest service and BLM land is intended to be \"working\" land. It\\'s viewed as a national resource, although it generally has to be used in a sustainable way. Various people\\'s and organization\\'s view of \"sustainable\" differ, however, so some serious controversies can erupt. Keep in mind that the Forest Service is part of the Department of Agriculture. You often see the slogan \"Land of many uses\" on signs as you enter and leave Forest Service land. While preservation can be a primary goal of some areas, others are managed for timber, for example. Hunting is also usually allowed, within state and local restrictions, of course. Most of the nation\\'s forest products come from National Forest lands. When the forest managers decide some area is ready to be harvested, they specify exactly what is allowed to be done where, and put it out for bid. So to answer your question more directly, you as someone hiking around might notice: Timber harvesting in progress. Hunting. More back country motorized vehicle use. Fewer facilities like vistor centers and interpretive programs for educating the public about the area and its nature. Fewer restrictions on where you are allowed to go and where you are allowed to camp. That all said, there is another designation, called a Wilderness Area 1 , that can exist within just about any kind of federal land. These places are strictly reserved for nature where \"the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain\" . This is the highest form of protection in the US. No permanent structures are allowed, including roads. Trails and trail signs are allowed. Some of the most awesome wilderness areas are within Forest Service and BLM land. These are truly places where you may take only pictures and leave only footprints, and you should be careful about the impact of the latter. 1 16 USC 1131-1136, Public Law 88-577, The Wilderness Act , 3 September 1964.',\n",

It gives no indication as to who is or is not allowed to use that path. The brown background indicates \"access land\". You can walk on this land subject to some restrictions. This applies regardless of whether there happens to be a path. \"access land\" is a relatively recent concept. It does not in of itself give any permission to cycle or ride horses. The green markings indicate public rights of way. A public footpath is somewhere that people are legally allowed to walk even if the landowner doesn\\'t much like the idea. A public bridleway similarly allows the public to walk, cycle or ride horses. A restricted byway aditionally allows non-motorised vehicles and a full byway allows all traffic. Often if you look carefully you will see that the green \"public right of way\" markings are printed on top of a marking indicating what (path/track/etc) is actually on the ground. Sometimes the official route of the right of way doesn\\'t exactly line up with the actual path. You can see this on your map where there is a \"kink\" in the public right of way but the actual path underneath goes straight through. Unfortunately while public footpaths, bridleways and byways are explicitly marked on OS maps there seems to be no disctinction on the map between public and private roads. You also get \"permissive footpaths\" where the landowner has decided to allow people to walk and permissive bridleways where the landowner has decided to allow people to walk/cycle/horseride. These are indicated in orange on the OS maps. The importand difference from public footpaths/bridleways is that the landowner can revoke the permission. Note that the above applies to England and Wales. In Scotland public rights of way are not shown on OS maps because there is no definitive map of them, only historic convention.',\n",

       "    'body': 'In my town, which is a neighborhood in a suburban location in Massachusetts, barefoot walking is common once the summer starts. I\\'m old and stay cold longer than most, so I don\\'t even switch over to sandals until long after people like you have taken off your shoes! My \"winter feet\" are soft and vulnerable, so it takes time to build the callous and thicker skin my \"summer feet\" need to protect from burning (to a degree), and being vulnerable to some of the small shards of things. I advise looking out for bigger rocks/stones. As your feet get bigger, so do the spaces between your toes, leaving you more susceptible to something getting caught between them, or in the space (arch) under your foot. Those can make you fall, and can be true on all the different surfaces you mentioned. In the most polite way possible, I\\'d also like to mention droppings from animals (scat). We have strict laws about cleaning up after your dog on the sidewalk or on people\\'s lawns, but I don\\'t know if you have that. Still, I have to remember to frequently look down on the sidewalks and roads as I walk. The same is true in your yard and on the trails. There can be diseases present in the scat, and sometimes hard things like berries which stick in your feet. You probably know all that, since that falls into your Mum\\'s category of diseases. Animals also dig in the yard, and along the trail. I\\'ve often stepped into holes I didn\\'t know were there and twisted toes and even an ankle. I even fell once and hurt my knee. Shoes can be helpful for support at times like that. I spend many hours in my garden during the summer, and always keep something on my feet, usually sneakers. There are a few more things that pertain to all of the areas where you walk. Tree \"droppings\" can be annoying, and potentially dangerous too. Nuts and acorns can be tripped over. Sap can be sticky and liable to cause a fall. Pinecones can be sharp enough to cause open sores. If people on your street have lots of trees, that may be an issue. The same is true along the trails you mentioned. Also in the yard and on the trails, certain insects, like ants, can bite if you step on them, and bees can sting. There\\'s a type of bee called a miner (or mining) bee that builds its nest in the ground, like anthills, and they can sting if you step on them. As I got older, I would go deeper into the woods and encounter things I didn\\'t used to before I hit your age. If you\\'re doing that, you might be technically in more danger of hurting your feet. You obviously know about things like rusty nails, discarded bottle caps and other sharp litter. Since you\\'re an experienced barefoot-walker, I\\'ll bet you\\'ve been careful of those your whole life! In my area, younger kids leave things lying around on the sidewalks, like small toys, or even bigger things like skateboards. I\\'ve often had to step out of the way, or over these things, so as not to trip. Shoes can offer protection if you do step on something like that. This may sound silly, but as I got older, I paid a lot less attention to what was on the ground and more to the people I was walking with, like friends. If that pertains to you, it might worry your Mum. You didn\\'t say that though, so I don\\'t want to put words in her mouth! If you don\\'t mind, I\\'d like to share a quick story from my life. When I became a teenager, I was allowed to go alone or with friends into stores, restaurants, and other places where bare feet weren\\'t allowed, so my Mum made a strict rule not to leave home without shoes on. That\\'s just my experience of mine, and doesn\\'t answer your question! You obviously have an excellent Mum who cares enough to worry about you, and has also taught you to be mature enough to come to a place like this and ask for advice.

For more local areas, try your county Extension agent (Extension programs are run through the State's land grant University), and they should at least be able to point you in the right direction. Also, I imagine most of these people who you call will have a good beat on the land you photographed and have an opinion on whether geotagging could be detrimental.

Strap on your pedaling shoes, and head out for a day of cycling. Whether you prefer mountain biking or street biking, most campgrounds support both camping activities. Don't forget to ask about bike-specific mountain trails or recreational bike paths. Plant Identification Though you might not notice at first, the plants at your campground may be very different from those where you live. Instead of hiking just to hike, spend your day IDing plants in the local forest. This not only gives you the chance to explore and stay active, but to learn something new, as well. Bird Watching You wake up to their songs in the morning, but do you know what those beautiful songbirds look like? Be sure to bring a bird identification book, and head out to discover who those singers are. S'mores Contest Some may argue that s'mores are the best part of any camping trip. So, why not put your skills to the test? This camping activity is great for all ages, and it's a win-win for everyone participating—and tasting. Boating If your campground is situated on a body of water, there's no better way to spend your day than splashing around. Most water-friendly campgrounds will offer kayak, canoe and paddle boat rentals making it easy to get out and come back in time for dinner over the fire. Volleyball A friendly game of volleyball is the one of the best group camping activities. If you don't have enough people for a game, take this chance to meet your neighbors and invite them to join in the fun. Call the campground to find out if they have a net or if you have to bring your own. Spelunking This is a unique experience if you can partake in it. Spelunking is the act of exploring caves, and can be enjoyed by most age groups. If you're camping near caves, ask your local ranger if they are safe to explore before going in and poking around. Fishing Of all the camping activities you can partake in, fishing might be the most relaxing. Grab your poles and head out with your family to catch dinner for the night, or simply enjoy the recreation of it.\",\n",

While it is true that there are less hikers in early June than later in the summer, there are reasons for this. Black flies can be quite annoying then. June is also wetter and muddier than early September. Avoid Labor Day weekend, but there will be fewer hikers immediately after that. September weather tends to be dryer with more clear days than other parts of the summer. Personally, my favorite time to hike in the White Mountains is from Labor Day until peak leaf season. That's in early to mid October, depending on elevation and weather specifics of that year. Timing isn't the only way to avoid crowds. Most of the people will be on the AT, or doing day hikes on a few of the popular trails that afford a out-and-back to some nice vista or other destination. The White Mountains has a large network of trails, with most of them not crowded at all, even during peak season. So don't do the Presi-traverse on the AT. You'll meet lots of people and have a hard time finding a place to camp at night. Instead, make a loop over more obscure side trails. It helps if you can spot a car, but there is also a shuttle bus system for hikers run by the AMC. I've done two and three night loops in the middle of summer west of Crawford Notch and hardly run into anyone once I got past casual day-hike range from the trailhead. If you insist on going up to the Presidential ridge, especially near Mt Washington or Lake of the Clouds or Madison huts, you're going to run into people. But that's only a tiny fraction of the available trails, especially if you have the flexibility to not have to get back to a trailhead for three days. Take a good look at the maps. Get the AMC maps printed on Tyvek. Those really do hold up well to water and other trail-abuse. The AMC does a decent job of keeping the trail information on those maps current.

       "    'body': \"@WeatherVane has already posted the permit link in a comment. Get your permits ASAP since you are at the 24 week window about now. They go fast - looks like Happy Isles TH is full through the current 24-week mark (9 Sep). You can get walk-up permits but lines are usually long and you won't have flexibility in your dates unless you're willing to hang around a day or two. You'll also need permits if you intend to hike to the top of Half Dome, which may be too tough or scary for the kids (need decent upper body/arm strength to pull up the cables). My son (then 14) didn't want to do it but other kids do, of course. If Lower Yosemite Valley isn't available, you can camp anywhere within regs near Sunset Creek, which is PAST (east) the Half Dome turnoff, but that makes for a quite tiring day for kids. I think your only other TH option to reach HD for such a quick trip with kids would be Sunrise Lakes, but it is also pretty much full. I would not recommend doing HD as a day trip (out and back in one day) with younger kids. That would be brutal. Also do not let them play anywhere near the top of the falls. Note that Yosemite requires the use of bear canisters for smellables in the wilderness, which they can rent to you . If you elect to just front country camp, which may also be tough to get a reservation , there are plenty of day hiking opportunities and sights to see in 3 days. It appears the window for that will open 0700 Pacific time on 15 April for dates through 14 Sep. They will be full within minutes most likely so be sure to follow their advice on how to increase your chances. Good luck! It is an incredibly beautiful park.\",\n",

The biggest impacts to back-country areas from non-motorized recreation come from vegetation disturbance: boots grinding up plants and breaking topsoil, tents compressing vegetation, camp activity destroying vegetation, fire scars, etc. A few inches of snow will largely protect the fragile flora beneath provided there is enough snow that you are not punching through to the soil/vegetation below. Thus, xc-skiing, snowshoeing, snowboarding, and downhill skiing will leave absolutely no trace of your passing -- again, provided there is enough snow. You do mention the tops of saplings sticking up. Avoid them. If when you pass on your board you see broken saplings in your wake, the snow is not deep enough. Use common sense. As for local fauna - they\\'re all pretty used to hiding in holes anyway, and your passing by on skis likely won\\'t disturb them. (A major exception is elk and deer calving grounds, which are often identified on US public lands maps, and are usually closed to snowmobiles and sometimes skiers.) The impacts you DO need to be concerned about are waste, trash, and etc. that easily get buried beneath snow where they seemingly \"disappear.\" Pack it in, pack it out. Of course, the biggest impact from non-motorized winter recreation is the motorized facilities of ski resorts which consume vast amounts of electricity to haul people up on lifts, diesel fuel to run snow cats that make those perfectly groomed trails, and development impacts that can encroach into wild lands.',\n",

I\\'d prefer to go somewhere free, but if the only options available are paid ranges I\\'ll do that. In talking to non-sportsmen they recommended driving out into the desert south of town. While I know it is legal to shoot on many types of public land I\\'d like something more concrete than a hand wave in a general direction. For example, where I grew up there was one shooting area on public land that was very well known and used. So well known and used that it is even marked on Google Maps as \"Keswick Dam Shooting Area.\" There was another area that was known and used but saw substantially less traffic because you had to walk a short ways in. Out of the tens of thousands of acres of public land in the area where it was legal to shoot these two spots were the places where everyone went to shoot. I\\'m looking for a similar situation in the Boise area. The main reason why I want to stick to the known shooting areas is I want to avoid having arguments with well intentioned random passerbys if what I\\'m doing is legal or not. Sticking to known shooting areas avoids this hassle. Also some areas are better than other areas. When these areas are on public land they end up seeing more shooters over time until they become known as the local shooting spot. I\\'d rather not reinvent the wheel and go to a known good area. Finally, if I can drive directly to a known good spot I will save time. If all I have is directions to a thousand acres of BLM land I have to search a thousand acres for a good backstop far enough away with protection from the wind along the shooting corridor and low probability that people/animals will wander into my line of fire. Known shooting spots will have solved these problems, and allow me to drive directly to that spot.',\n",

I recommend that you get in contact with the Cape Town section of the MCSA and ask about longer hiking trips. Generally you have to consider that most land in RSA is private property and owners may not allow trespassing. But if the MCSA tells you about routes this may be no issue because they should have an agreement with the land owners. Crime is definitely an issue in RSA. A huge number of South Africans belong to the poor and if you show your wealth around, someone may help you getting rid of it. These people will hardly understand why someone hikes through their country, wearing/carrying all the sophisticated outdoor stuff which they never will be able to buy. Of course you won't meet as much people as in the cities but you have to be aware of this. A good way to deal with this issue would be to never do a hike on your own. Always go in groups or join organized trips. At the end one little story. We wanted to hike to the top of the cable car in Hartbeestpoort but the officials (employees at the cable way station) denied access although we knew that there is a trail and it would be possible for us to reach the summit in about 2 hours.

If you pee on the ground, everyone is forced to smell it. If you litter, everyone is forced to walk around garbage. From where I'm from, etiquette regarding outdoor activities is very simple: try to minimize what you subject other people to as much as possible. If I can pee in a far away place where the smell won't bother anyone, that's where I'll go; if I can carry my garbage with me, I will; if I can play an instrument being absolutely sure I'm not upsetting someone, then that's OK. The problem is: can you be sure? Do you know what's the mean distance your instrument reaches? People around you might enjoy your playing, but do people 500m from there feel OK about it too? How can you be sure? There are also animals around - do they love it? I'm positive most animals don't care about where I pee, but I'm also sure littering won't do them any good. Are you sure you're not disturbing? I think my position has become clear: I'm totally against any kind of outdoors musicality. I often climb big walls where I'm supposed to sleep three, four days on the wall, and some friends sometimes bring ukeleles. I hate it. I tolerate it because usually the other two guys enjoy the music and I'm in a smaller number, but I hate it. I hate to see people playing instruments or hearing loud music on trails. I think it's an absolute lack of respect for the others and for your surroundings. The safest way to be respectful is to be clean, to be silent, to be invisible - to walk and climb as if you were a shadow.

I know that some parks are more lax than others about camping at unofficial sites. (I know and practice leave no trace.)

Make sure they have the right clothes for the weather, that you carry enough food, water and treats and that your breaks are in a comfortable setting to sit and enjoy. Make the walk short but with a very clear goal : climb a peak, reach a waterfall, etc. Another part of it is to try and find a circular trail so they don\\'t feel they are \"going back\". Pack a handful of things they don\\'t expect : maybe a few cold beers for when you reach your mid walk goal, an excellent coffee kit for some really nice coffee with fresh pastries and so on. If possible on the trail, find a perceived dangerous point that will give them something to talk about later on and will become their \"type 2 fun\" to think back on. This can be walking on a small exposed ledge, crossing a river etc. Just make sure you can keep all of you safe there. The trick is to think about all the things that you are happy to grind your teeth and ignore in the outdoors as part of the bigger picture while hiking and eliminate them as potential problems. Good luck in getting them to join. If you do succeed the feeling is great!',\n",

The main advantage is the 1:40,000 scale which offers most of the detail of a 1:25,000 map while covering a larger area. Additionally, they don't have many irrelevant features like county boundaries and slightly more colourful style than OS maps, which make it easier to understand the map at a glance. The larger area of the maps allows them to cover more useful areas where multiple 1:25000 maps would be needed. Particularly the Lakes, which are covered by 4 OS maps compared to 1 Harvey map. Additionally, their waterproofness is pretty good and can make them much easier to use than using a mapcase or a laminated OS map, which are much more bulky. Obviously as OS maps cover the entire country Harvey maps are never strictly necessary, but in many situations they can provide an, at least arguably, better alternative to OS maps.\",\n",

       "    'body': 'Camping restrictions and permits to enter particular areas are actually very rare when you look at the total land area. I believe in every case these are done only to prevent degradation caused by excessive use. By definition, these systems are therefore in place in popular areas, which is why you hear about them way out of proportion to their actual size and numbers. I have gotten a permit and gone backpacking in the north part of Yosemite National Park. That is a very popular area, and I can see how it would be damaged if everyone could just go there without the numbers being limited. However, there is no limit on adjacent land in the national forest, mostly because the demand isn\\'t there and limiting the numbers not necessary. There are partial restrictions in the White Mountain National Forest of New Hampshire. These are different due to the different circumstances, patterns of demand, and level of damage overuse can cause. There are no permits and restriction of individuals, and some of the popular trails can get quite crowded. There are restrictions on the size of groups and where you are allowed to camp in the back country. Some of these restrictions move around as damage from overuse shifts. The general rule is to stay 1/4 mile from fixed installations like huts and purpose-built campsites, but also around what would otherwise be popular and overrun areas. For example, you are not allowed to camp near the top of Thoreau Falls. That was done because too may people did and the area became heavily damaged. All that was left was bare ground and large trees. Everything else got trampled. The place looked unreal. On the other hand, there is no restriction on total numbers of people on the trails. Some of the trails are heavily used and heavily worn, but since that stays local to the trail there is no widespread damage and no attempt to limit numbers. Last summer I did a 10 mile or so day hike that looped over a part of Franconia Ridge that is also the Appalachian Trail. We probably encountered at least 100 people on that hike, and that\\'s not counting the people around Greenleaf Hut, which was on our loop. There are also many parts of the US that are open to the public where you can hike all day and are unlikely to run into a single person. I have done exactly that in various places in Arizona, for example, in both the desert and the mountains. What makes that possible is the huge amount of public land there. Europeans seem to have a hard time grasping just how vast some of these open spaces are, probably because there is nothing like them in Europe. There are no restictions there because there is no need for them. All the people that want to go there do, and the damage is minimal, so no need to regulate. Take a look at a map of Arizona and New Mexico. Add up the land area of the abutting Coconino, Tonto, Apache, Sitgreaves, and Gila National forests alone, and compare that to the size of a few smaller European countries. Now consider that except for a few towns that are \"holes\" in the forest, nobody actually lives there premanently. So in summary, restrictions on camping locations and numbers of people are only done grudgingly as a necessity to protect the resource so that others can enjoy it in perpetuity. Such restrictions are actually quite rare, limited to particularly popular areas. There are vast less popular places where anyone is welcome to hike around and camp with little restriction. Added: To put the vastness of these areas in perspective, the total land area of the contiguous patch of national forest formed by the Coconino, Apache-Sitgreaves, Gila, and Tonto National Forests is 15.7k square miles. That just about the size of Switzerland, which is 15.9k square miles. That doesn\\'t include other nearby public lands, such as the Prescott, Cibola, and Coronado National Forests, for another 7.3k sqm. There are more smaller national forests and wilderness areas on BLM land scattered about Arizona, and the Grand Canyon National park and lots more north into Utah. Ryan mentioned Utah. Putting that into a European perspective, it\\'s about the size of Great Britain (Utah 84.9 ksqm, GB 88.7 ksqm) but Utah only has a population of 2.8 Mpeople. In contrast, England alone has 53 Mpeople. And most of Utah\\'s people are concetrated in a metropolitan strip along the eastern edges of the Great Salt Lake and Utah Lake. That leaves very few people living in the large remaining wild areas. Yellowstone National Park may get 3M visitors per year, but consider it\\'s 1/3 the size of Belgium. The entire national forest system is larger than France, Belgium, and The Netherlands combined . And that doesn\\'t include the national parks, like Yellostone, Yosemite, the Grand Canyon, and many others. 2.7M more people live in London than Utah and Nevada combined, which have a total land area over twice that of Great Britain. The point is that it\\'s very easy to get a totally wrong impression of wild places in the US because the few well known popular spots are not representative, and by necessity of their popularity must be managed differently. Europeans also don\\'t seem to get the vastness of the place until they\\'ve been here. Spend a day driving accross Nevada on Route 50 and realize it takes more than one tank of gas to get between two places anyone would call a city. Or spend some time in a wilderness area in the Arizona desert and realize you haven\\'t seen a single person in the two days since you left the last paved road. There are many wild, beautiful, and vast places that are open to anyone who wants to come. In fact, that is the case for most of the public lands in the United States. In general, wild areas here are more wild, less crowded, and less restricted than those in Europe. There are also a great many more of them. Come and visit some time.',\n",

       "    'body': 'In Ontario, the relevant terminology is \"Crown Land\". This is land that is not owned by any private entity, and is essentially free for use, however there are some rules. Most of the province is crown land, and from Ottawa you can access it quite readily. With regards to fishing, fishing in any body of water (Except privately owned/stocked facilities) requires a fishing license. These are very cheap (under $20 a year for a \"conservation\" license) and include rules about what species can be harvested and in what quantities. The province is broken into regions and the rules may vary between regions. All of this information is easily available from whereever you obtain your license. You can do so online, but might prefer to hit a local fishing shop in Ottawa or the region you will be fishing in to chat and get some local knowledge. For camping, I believe you can camp anywhere on crown land, but there may be set-back requirements from roads. I am not sure about cutting of trees to build a shelter, I believe any structure must be temporary in nature, a simple wood cabin may be still be considered permanent. However, realistically any action of enforcement is going to be complaint based. If your activities aren\\'t extreme and aren\\'t bothering anyone, you could easily get away with building a simple structure.

Although you can get through quickly if you take take the route from Tjåmotis into Aktse and you might make it to Akkastugorna in 5 days, I would not recommend it. You should take extra days in case of delays, and if you are not late, you can use those extra days for detours or day trips. However, if you mean you have 7 days to get from Aktse to Kisuris (for example), you should be OK. Kungsleden (the mountain \"highway\" full of cabins and trails so well maintained they remind of North American National Parks) leads through the far southeastern corner of the park, from Saltoluokta via Aktse to Kvikkjokk. At Aktse, you can take a boat to a point under Nammásj. From here, there is a reasonably good trail all the way to Skarja and Kutjaure at the tri-park-point with Stora Sjöfallet and Padjelanta. Although this trail is not an official trail and contains some laborious stretches, in particular through Rapaselet, it is nowhere difficult by Sarek standards, and at times actually has wooden planks laid out through wet areas. However, you will still need a tent and you will still need to ford streams. There are no navigational challenges. This route is popular and if you hike it in summer, you will meet plenty of other people, probably several groups every day. That makes it easier as well, because you will not need to bring equipment such as a satellite phone: in summer on the trail you are certain to meet other people who may be of assistance in case of an emergency (by warning authorities as soon as they reach civilisation).

If you do one thing in Sarek, hike to Skierffe — you can do it as a day trip from Aktse. You can also hike from Skierffe down to Rapadalen (we did this in 2013) but that requires more off-trail navigation including through the woods.

The regulations for what can be done in a national monument or park (the only difference between the two is that one is established by presidential edict, the other by act of congress) are pretty strict, so there won't be huge differences in what you are allowed to do in one national monument compared to another. That said, each different park or monument is run by different people who will invetably make different decisions about details. However, more significant differences arise due to the nature of the park/monument itself. Yosemite is relatively small, particularly the valley, and close to major population centers. As a result, it gets a lot of visitors, and this can't be ignored in formulating detailed policy. For example, the numbers of people in the valley are limited, and you need a permit to stay overnight in the back country. Grand Staircase / Escalante, in contrast is large, farther from large populations, and the main attractions more spread out. There is no attempt to limit numbers, even in the most popular places like the Dry Gulch slot canyons. It's far enough and hard enough to get to that the numbers of visitors is way less than Yosemite Valley, so management policies can be much looser. The general feeling is that the BLM is more laid back about things than the Park Service, but that is really hard to measure because of the kinds of lands the two agencies manage and what they are charged with. Would the Park Service manage Grand Staircase / Escalante all that differently? It's really hard to say since comparing it to places like Yosemite and Yellowstone is apples to oranges. The BLM manages so few parks/monuments that it's hard to say whether there is a significantly different philosophy compared to the Park Service for lands that are mandated to have the same level of protection . My personal impression is that there isn't much difference. The few parks/monuments the BLM does manage are more out of the way and less major tourist attractions than many of the Park Service parks/monuments. To make any kind of fair comparison, you'd have to look at Park Service parks/monuments that are also similarly out of the way and less visited. The BLM does manage a significant number of Wildernesses. These have even a higher level of protection than National Parks or Monuments. I've been to a number of them, and haven't really noticed much difference in how Wildernesses are managed by the BLM, the Forest Service, or the Park Service. The one difference that does stand out is not in how the resource is managed or what you're allowed to do, but in interpretive programs. The Park Service has ranger-naturalists that lead guided hikes, give talks, and the like. This is either rare or non-existant in parks/monuments run by other agencies as far as I have experienced. Park Service parks/monuments are more likely to have a entrance fee, perhaps as a result of the extra services offered. Grand Staircase / Escalante does have a visitor center, which is actually quite nice and doesn't feel any different from visitor centers I've been to for lands run by the Park Service. However, I don't recall nature programs offered there as you would usually find in a Park Service park, although I wasn't explicitly looking for them when I was there last summer.\",\n",

No one method is really perfect at removing everything, so I usually use a two-stage approach: Filter : If the water source is cloudy, your first step should be to remove the larger impurities. You can buy expensive pump filters for this, or you can just pour the water through a sock, bandanna, or any other tightly-woven fabric to remove the larger stuff. Note that you can probably skip this step if the water you're collecting is clear and fast-moving. Boil : Heat sterilization is really the only sure-fire way to kill bacteria, viruses and other undesirable microbial life in your water. It's a commonly used technique to clean medical instruments since it's so effective. It does require a heat source, and it'll take some time to get a full rolling boil. But if you're at all worried about the quality of your water, it's your safest bet. Edit: As commenters noted, if you're in an area with potential chemical pollutants or metals in the water, you should filter even if the water appears clear. But if you're really in a situation where mother nature's water has been tainted by man-made waste, you should probably pack in all of your own water anyways.\",\n",

Don\\'t even start unless you\\'ve got one of these. A belay device Don\\'t think you\\'re going to be able to be safely protected just grabbing the rope. A belay device places lots of friction on the rope, so you can easily control the stopping force by simply controlling the angle the rope enters the belay device. A dynamic climbing rope The real, expensive stuff, UIAA certified dynamic single rope. Not the stuff you get at the hardware store for $8.99 on sale. While you may only weigh 150-250 pounds, when you fall, the force placed on the rope is many times your body weight. Further, the rope is responsible for absorbing the energy of a fall, and if not properly designed for this purpose either it or the climber will break in a serious fall. Hardware store ropes aren\\'t designed to absorb impact energy, even if they are \"strong enough\" in terms of working load. A climbing harness. This is how you attach yourself to the rope. From what I\\'ve seen, the difference between harnesses for different applications boils down to how light they are, and how many gear loops you get. If you are just starting out, find a reasonably priced one that\\'s comfortable, and worry about the other stuff and upgrade after you\\'re a skilled climber. And of course, learn to tie in both yourself and your belayer and practice until you can nearly do it properly with your eyes closed. Shoes You\\'ll want shoes. Real climbing shoes. I\\'ve tried climbing barefoot and with vibrams before. It doesn\\'t work well. Different shoes have different ratings for how suitable they are for gym vs outdoor climbing.

Successful friction fires requires both good equipment and good technique. If you are just starting out, and you won\\'t know if your failures are caused by equipment or technique. This can make learning very difficult. One fix is to buy a good set from an expert. Learn to make fires with it, then make your own kit. Making any fire requires multiple skills , which you apply in a sequence. A friction method will produce a tiny coal. Once you\\'ve mastered that, you still need to be able to make the coal in to a flame (with tinder). Once your tinder is going, you need to light the kindling. Usually you\\'ll add progressively larger fuel to grow the fire for your purposes. Then you need to know how to put the fire out safely . Each of these stages is its own set of skills to learn. Each is contextual (type of wood available, season, weather, etc.). Wet weather is especially challenging, so start learning when it\\'s not raining. However, watch out for your dry season, when runaway fires are particularly risky. Check with your fire department for burn bans . There is no mastery of fire-making.

There\\'s a waterproof \"top lid\" that can bind down, it\\'s not impossible to stuff the sleeping bag between the pack and the top lid and cinch it down, but this is sort of awkward and top-heavy. What\\'s the proper strategy here? Any tips for attaching my sleeping bag and tent to my pack? Edit : I\\'m not totally opposed to putting my tent and sleeping bag in the pack, especially for short and light trips, but on a multi-week outing, I may end up with the lion\\'s share of the gear and food to haul, depending on the company. If there\\'s a clever way to have stuff outside my pack, it would be nice to have the option.',\n",

People often look down and all around them for clues, but I\\'ve seen people really struggle to find caches in plain sight if they\\'re above head height! Equally, look up for clues as well - I hid a cache with the clue \"underneath 3 cables\" (those cables being cables in plain sight running about 20 foot in the air) and you\\'d be surprised how many people looked for ages because they didn\\'t get the clue!

One particular clue was \"CND\", and the cache site was a few fence posts roughly in the shape of the corresponding flag. Being too young, I had no idea what \"CND\" meant at all - my parents were right on it however! Remember that caches can be all sorts of objects. They\\'re not always just the obvious tin - I easily found one recently that was a (toy) frog, and many people had missed it on the assumption that just couldn\\'t be it. Know when to give up. Seriously, if you can\\'t find it having searched around for a couple of hours and the previous 6 logs were all DNFs (did not find), there\\'s a very good chance it\\'s no longer there.

A good supply of wood in varying sizes to build your way up from the kindling You can either stack the kindling around or on top of your tinder before lighting it, or add it as the tinder burns. Flame tends to burn from the bottom up, so starting tinder on top of kindling is not going to work as well (if at all). If you are using matches, stack some kindling around or on top of the tinder, making a sort of \"log cabin\" or \"tipi\" out of small sticks. Make sure to leave room for air to get to the flame, and an opening for your match to light the tinder. Once your tinder is lit, the flame should slowly grow, consuming the tinder and igniting the kindling. Gently blowing on the flame will add oxygen and help this process along. Keep adding wood and blowing or fanning as needed, and gradually increase the size of the wood you add as the flame grows. Before long you\\'ll have a nice flame going and you\\'ll be able to sit back and enjoy the warmth.',\n",

As noted in other posts, carry more layers with you than you may need. This doesn't mean you need a down puff. Consider what the weather is like in the area you will be. Consult forecasts before going out and consider your own level of tolerance for exposure. Avoid cotton. Cotton does not retain warmth when wet. As noted, get out of the wind. Look for or build a shelter that will break the wind. The wind will disturb your outer layer of warmth. I carry a lightweight wind/rain layer with me on every hike, it lives permanently at the bottom of my pack.

Once you've got a nice fire going with the kindling you can look to add bigger logs, again gradually and making sure they're thoroughly dry, until you have a fire the size you need.

It can also take a much heavier load more easily - which is why you will often see trail-crew workers hauling heavy and awkward tools with them.

It's worth pointing out that while for some (and probably most people here) wild camping means free-camping wandering around with a tent and supplies on foot, for many others it can mean driving around and parking up somewhere in a motor home. I refer to the first variety here, and this is the sort that is much less likely to give you problems (especially in countries where it's borderline.) In any country, but especially those where it's more of a grey area, if you know where you're going beforehand then a quick call to the landowner (if any) to check that it's ok won't do you any harm. While it may not always be necessary, it may help to put your mind at rest so you're not worried about being approached or asked to leave during your stay. Anyway, a general summary of countries in that link and elsewhere: France (See above link) A legal grey area, but is generally tolerated with the permission of landowners, or if you're well away from tourist sites. Don't light any fires. England and Wales (See above link) Generally not allowed without prior permission, though there are some exceptions (Dartmoor being the biggest one.) Scotland (See above link) Legal pretty much anywhere. Ireland It's tolerated in the more rural places, though it may be wise to obtain permission beforehand if you can. Spain and Portugal I believe it's tolerated but only in certain locations. Best to check with the landowner first to be sure. Germany Most of the links I can find suggest that it's not strictly speaking legal, but that many people have done it without any issues (providing you follow sensible precautions of course.) Netherlands Generally not allowed. There are a few spots where it is allowed, near a designated pole for so called 'pole camping' ( paalkamperen ) Italy (See above link) It doesn't seem to be tolerated, in fact most sources I can find seem to say it's explicitly banned in many places . Having said that, the same link also says there's lots of good campsites in a lot of nice locations around, so that may be your alternative. (Edit: This may be a little harsher than reality, see Tullochgorum's comment below.) Greece (See above link) Illegal, but the rule is apparently rampantly ignored, with many unpoliced areas. The risk is on you if you try it here. Norway Legal pretty much anywhere. Right to Roam . Sweden Legal pretty much anywhere. Outdoor Access Rights . Finland Legal pretty much anywhere. Everyman’s rights and the code of conduct on private land . Bulgaria (See above link) An interesting one - I can't find any sources saying whether it's legal or not, but in the summer apparently hundreds of hippy families relocate to the beaches, wild camp there and often strip nude for good measure. Estonia (See above link) A legal grey area, widely tolerated but best to obtain permission from the land owner beforehand. Albania Legal here on public land, but sometimes restricted for environmental reasons. Check first. Austria Can't find any authoritative sources. General consensus is that it seems to be discouraged, but as long as you're sensible then there shouldn't be an issue. Faroe Islands Not permitted .

I would advise anyone planning on heading out into the hills to read both of these excellent books - Langmuir is the book for British Mountain Leader Training, and the Mountaineers covers a lot extra information for activities over in North America. I don\\'t think being away from the treeline is particular problematic (unless you are the only thing on a very flat piece of ground). As long as you are not on the top of a ridge/hill, then there is a safe \"shadow zone\" on the side of the hill - I think something of the order of 2/3 of the way between the hilltop and its base. The only thing is - you should sit on top of a plastic sheet or your backpack to prevent picking up stray eddy currents from the ground. From Langmuir (Mountaincraft and Leadership, 3rd Edition): You can get a shadow from a 7m or taller cliff where the safe zone is between 3m from the base out to the height of the cliff - this means standing 5m from a 7m cliff should reduce your chance of a lightning strike (note - reduce - there is still a chance you can get hit, there is no 0%). There is a diagram on page 227 of 3rd Edition - I can\\'t find one to link to, unfortunately. He doesn\\'t say how steep the cliff should be, though. If you enter a cave for shelter (or dive under a boulder) - you must have at least 3m head room (so - 5m total) and 1m to either side. From The Mountaineers (Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills, 6th Edition): These guys are pretty clear: If thunderstorms are forecast: Do not camp or climb in a narrow valley or gully Do not plan to climb or hike in high, exposed areas Watch small cumulus clouds for strong, upward growth Keep track of weather reports If you spot a thunderstorm: Get away from water Seek low ground in an open valley or meadow Move immediately if your hair stands on end Do not stand under trees, especially in open areas Do not remain near metal or graphite equipment Insulate yourself from the ground with your pack or a foam mat Crouch to minimise your profile Do not lie down Gauge the movement of the thunderstorm',\n",

       "   'body': \"After a bit of digging I found this , which covers some in Europe (not extensively as I first thought!) It's worth pointing out that while for some (and probably most people here) wild camping means free-camping wandering around with a tent and supplies on foot, for many others it can mean driving around and parking up somewhere in a motor home. I refer to the first variety here, and this is the sort that is much less likely to give you problems (especially in countries where it's borderline.) In any country, but especially those where it's more of a grey area, if you know where you're going beforehand then a quick call to the landowner (if any) to check that it's ok won't do you any harm. While it may not always be necessary, it may help to put your mind at rest so you're not worried about being approached or asked to leave during your stay. Anyway, a general summary of countries in that link and elsewhere: France (See above link) A legal grey area, but is generally tolerated with the permission of landowners, or if you're well away from tourist sites. Don't light any fires. England and Wales (See above link) Generally not allowed without prior permission, though there are some exceptions (Dartmoor being the biggest one.) Scotland (See above link) Legal pretty much anywhere. Ireland It's tolerated in the more rural places, though it may be wise to obtain permission beforehand if you can. Spain and Portugal I believe it's tolerated but only in certain locations. Best to check with the landowner first to be sure. Germany Most of the links I can find suggest that it's not strictly speaking legal, but that many people have done it without any issues (providing you follow sensible precautions of course.) Netherlands Generally not allowed. There are a few spots where it is allowed, near a designated pole for so called 'pole camping' ( paalkamperen ) Italy (See above link) It doesn't seem to be tolerated, in fact most sources I can find seem to say it's explicitly banned in many places . Having said that, the same link also says there's lots of good campsites in a lot of nice locations around, so that may be your alternative. (Edit: This may be a little harsher than reality, see Tullochgorum's comment below.) Greece (See above link) Illegal, but the rule is apparently rampantly ignored, with many unpoliced areas. The risk is on you if you try it here. Norway Legal pretty much anywhere. Right to Roam . Sweden Legal pretty much anywhere. Outdoor Access Rights . Finland Legal pretty much anywhere. Everyman’s rights and the code of conduct on private land . Bulgaria (See above link) An interesting one - I can't find any sources saying whether it's legal or not, but in the summer apparently hundreds of hippy families relocate to the beaches, wild camp there and often strip nude for good measure. Estonia (See above link) A legal grey area, widely tolerated but best to obtain permission from the land owner beforehand. Albania Legal here on public land, but sometimes restricted for environmental reasons. Check first. Austria Can't find any authoritative sources. General consensus is that it seems to be discouraged, but as long as you're sensible then there shouldn't be an issue. Faroe Islands Not permitted . Camping is only permitted at designated campsites.\",\n",

A good supply of wood in varying sizes to build your way up from the kindling You can either stack the kindling around or on top of your tinder before lighting it, or add it as the tinder burns. Flame tends to burn from the bottom up, so starting tinder on top of kindling is not going to work as well (if at all). If you are using matches, stack some kindling around or on top of the tinder, making a sort of \"log cabin\" or \"tipi\" out of small sticks. Make sure to leave room for air to get to the flame, and an opening for your match to light the tinder. Once your tinder is lit, the flame should slowly grow, consuming the tinder and igniting the kindling. Gently blowing on the flame will add oxygen and help this process along. Keep adding wood and blowing or fanning as needed, and gradually increase the size of the wood you add as the flame grows.

A dynamic climbing rope The real, expensive stuff, UIAA certified dynamic single rope. Not the stuff you get at the hardware store for $8.99 on sale. While you may only weigh 150-250 pounds, when you fall, the force placed on the rope is many times your body weight. Further, the rope is responsible for absorbing the energy of a fall, and if not properly designed for this purpose either it or the climber will break in a serious fall. Hardware store ropes aren\\'t designed to absorb impact energy, even if they are \"strong enough\" in terms of working load. A climbing harness. This is how you attach yourself to the rope.

It's worth pointing out that while for some (and probably most people here) wild camping means free-camping wandering around with a tent and supplies on foot, for many others it can mean driving around and parking up somewhere in a motor home. I refer to the first variety here, and this is the sort that is much less likely to give you problems (especially in countries where it's borderline.) In any country, but especially those where it's more of a grey area, if you know where you're going beforehand then a quick call to the landowner (if any) to check that it's ok won't do you any harm. While it may not always be necessary, it may help to put your mind at rest so you're not worried about being approached or asked to leave during your stay. Anyway, a general summary of countries in that link and elsewhere: France (See above link) A legal grey area, but is generally tolerated with the permission of landowners, or if you're well away from tourist sites. Don't light any fires. England and Wales (See above link) Generally not allowed without prior permission, though there are some exceptions (Dartmoor being the biggest one.) Scotland (See above link) Legal pretty much anywhere. Ireland It's tolerated in the more rural places, though it may be wise to obtain permission beforehand if you can. Spain and Portugal I believe it's tolerated but only in certain locations. Best to check with the landowner first to be sure. Germany Most of the links I can find suggest that it's not strictly speaking legal, but that many people have done it without any issues (providing you follow sensible precautions of course.) Netherlands Generally not allowed. There are a few spots where it is allowed, near a designated pole for so called 'pole camping' ( paalkamperen ) Italy (See above link) It doesn't seem to be tolerated, in fact most sources I can find seem to say it's explicitly banned in many places . Having said that, the same link also says there's lots of good campsites in a lot of nice locations around, so that may be your alternative. (Edit: This may be a little harsher than reality, see Tullochgorum's comment below.) Greece (See above link) Illegal, but the rule is apparently rampantly ignored, with many unpoliced areas. The risk is on you if you try it here. Norway Legal pretty much anywhere. Right to Roam . Sweden Legal pretty much anywhere. Outdoor Access Rights . Finland Legal pretty much anywhere. Everyman’s rights and the code of conduct on private land . Bulgaria (See above link) An interesting one - I can't find any sources saying whether it's legal or not, but in the summer apparently hundreds of hippy families relocate to the beaches, wild camp there and often strip nude for good measure. Estonia (See above link) A legal grey area, widely tolerated but best to obtain permission from the land owner beforehand. Albania Legal here on public land, but sometimes restricted for environmental reasons. Check first. Austria Can't find any authoritative sources. General consensus is that it seems to be discouraged, but as long as you're sensible then there shouldn't be an issue. Faroe Islands Not permitted .

If the place your GPS guides you to doesn\\'t make sense, don\\'t necessarily stick to that one spot, walk around, but... Don\\'t scout randomly, use a methodical route. All too often people make the mistakes of walking around randomly and coming back to the same couple of places, missing the more subtle place that they would have found otherwise... I tend to check the obvious places first and then cover the area more thoroughly. Look up. People often look down and all around them for clues, but I\\'ve seen people really struggle to find caches in plain sight if they\\'re above head height! Equally, look up for clues as well - I hid a cache with the clue \"underneath 3 cables\" (those cables being cables in plain sight running about 20 foot in the air) and you\\'d be surprised how many people looked for ages because they didn\\'t get the clue! Bounce ideas off someone else. If you don\\'t understand the clue, ask someone else if they have any ideas. Sometimes something you\\'ve been pondering over for hours can jump out near instantly to someone else! One particular clue was \"CND\", and the cache site was a few fence posts roughly in the shape of the corresponding flag. Being too young, I had no idea what \"CND\" meant at all - my parents were right on it however! Remember that caches can be all sorts of objects. They\\'re not always just the obvious tin - I easily found one recently that was a (toy) frog, and many people had missed it on the assumption that just couldn\\'t be it. Know when to give up. Seriously, if you can\\'t find it having searched around for a couple of hours and the previous 6 logs were all DNFs (did not find), there\\'s a very good chance it\\'s no longer there.

Takes all of 2 seconds and could save you wandering around lost for hours.

This takes a lot of practice. Hand callouses help. YouTube has many videos: Fire Plow (YouTube) . Even further on the skill end of the scale is the fire plow . Basically you push a stick along a groove in a board. I\\'ve heard that native people of the Pacific Northwest would walk up to a cedar tree, cut groove in the side of the tree, and plow up a coal right there. Again, see YouTube: Fire Plow (YouTube) . Successful friction fires requires both good equipment and good technique. If you are just starting out, and you won\\'t know if your failures are caused by equipment or technique. This can make learning very difficult. One fix is to buy a good set from an expert. Learn to make fires with it, then make your own kit. Making any fire requires multiple skills , which you apply in a sequence. A friction method will produce a tiny coal. Once you\\'ve mastered that, you still need to be able to make the coal in to a flame (with tinder). Once your tinder is going, you need to light the kindling. Usually you\\'ll add progressively larger fuel to grow the fire for your purposes. Then you need to know how to put the fire out safely . Each of these stages is its own set of skills to learn. Each is contextual (type of wood available, season, weather, etc.). Wet weather is especially challenging, so start learning when it\\'s not raining. However, watch out for your dry season, when runaway fires are particularly risky. Check with your fire department for burn bans . There is no mastery of fire-making.

I learned this the hard way... So in addition to a polarizer, any goggles you use in the outdoors should have something that darkens independent of orientation. How much depends on where you want to go. Just in the mountains where there is some snow, or onto glaciers and ice fields where you'll see nothing but snow for days.

This is something people in an outdoors store should be able to explain to you. Another very important thing to watch out for is stray light. What I also learned the hard way is that clip-on sunshades for your regular glasses let too much light in from the sides. You want to make sure that once you wear your goggles, any light that reaches your eyes must travel through the glasses. Again, on a glacier or in snow, light comes from all directions.

       "   'body': 'There are many, many ways to make a fire. Some require more skill, while others depend on carefully prepared equipment. The closest thing to \"rubbing two sticks together\" is the hand-drill . You will need a fireboard (a small cedar board is good) and a thin, straight stick. A knife is good, too. This takes a lot of practice. Hand callouses help. YouTube has many videos: Fire Plow (YouTube) . Even further on the skill end of the scale is the fire plow . Basically you push a stick along a groove in a board. I\\'ve heard that native people of the Pacific Northwest would walk up to a cedar tree, cut groove in the side of the tree, and plow up a coal right there. Again, see YouTube: Fire Plow (YouTube) . Successful friction fires requires both good equipment and good technique. If you are just starting out, and you won\\'t know if your failures are caused by equipment or technique. This can make learning very difficult. One fix is to buy a good set from an expert. Learn to make fires with it, then make your own kit. Making any fire requires multiple skills , which you apply in a sequence. A friction method will produce a tiny coal. Once you\\'ve mastered that, you still need to be able to make the coal in to a flame (with tinder). Once your tinder is going, you need to light the kindling. Usually you\\'ll add progressively larger fuel to grow the fire for your purposes. Then you need to know how to put the fire out safely . Each of these stages is its own set of skills to learn. Each is contextual (type of wood available, season, weather, etc.). Wet weather is especially challenging, so start learning when it\\'s not raining. However, watch out for your dry season, when runaway fires are particularly risky. Check with your fire department for burn bans . There is no mastery of fire-making. Sometimes, when you\\'re sure that you\\'re doing everything right, you still can\\'t get a good fire going. Consider it a spiritual practice .',\n",

It's worth pointing out that while for some (and probably most people here) wild camping means free-camping wandering around with a tent and supplies on foot, for many others it can mean driving around and parking up somewhere in a motor home. I refer to the first variety here, and this is the sort that is much less likely to give you problems (especially in countries where it's borderline.) In any country, but especially those where it's more of a grey area, if you know where you're going beforehand then a quick call to the landowner (if any) to check that it's ok won't do you any harm. While it may not always be necessary, it may help to put your mind at rest so you're not worried about being approached or asked to leave during your stay. Anyway, a general summary of countries in that link and elsewhere: France (See above link) A legal grey area, but is generally tolerated with the permission of landowners, or if you're well away from tourist sites. Don't light any fires. England and Wales (See above link) Generally not allowed without prior permission, though there are some exceptions (Dartmoor being the biggest one.) Scotland (See above link) Legal pretty much anywhere. Ireland It's tolerated in the more rural places, though it may be wise to obtain permission beforehand if you can. Spain and Portugal I believe it's tolerated but only in certain locations. Best to check with the landowner first to be sure. Germany Most of the links I can find suggest that it's not strictly speaking legal, but that many people have done it without any issues (providing you follow sensible precautions of course.) Netherlands Generally not allowed. There are a few spots where it is allowed, near a designated pole for so called 'pole camping' ( paalkamperen ) Italy (See above link) It doesn't seem to be tolerated, in fact most sources I can find seem to say it's explicitly banned in many places . Having said that, the same link also says there's lots of good campsites in a lot of nice locations around, so that may be your alternative. (Edit: This may be a little harsher than reality, see Tullochgorum's comment below.) Greece (See above link) Illegal, but the rule is apparently rampantly ignored, with many unpoliced areas. The risk is on you if you try it here. Norway Legal pretty much anywhere. Right to Roam . Sweden Legal pretty much anywhere. Outdoor Access Rights . Finland Legal pretty much anywhere. Everyman’s rights and the code of conduct on private land . Bulgaria (See above link) An interesting one - I can't find any sources saying whether it's legal or not, but in the summer apparently hundreds of hippy families relocate to the beaches, wild camp there and often strip nude for good measure. Estonia (See above link) A legal grey area, widely tolerated but best to obtain permission from the land owner beforehand. Albania Legal here on public land, but sometimes restricted for environmental reasons. Check first. Austria Can't find any authoritative sources. General consensus is that it seems to be discouraged, but as long as you're sensible then there shouldn't be an issue. Faroe Islands Not permitted . Camping is only permitted at designated campsites.\",\n",

When I was in camp, we'd use these when making climbing harnesses out of webbing, since they were so safe.

[link] Double Fisherman's Knot: Use this when you need to attach two ropes together, as it holds very well when force is applied in the direction of the rope. Essentially just a double overhand knot on two ropes tied around each other. [link] Slip Knot: Use this when you need a knot, but you'll be undoing it frequently. It is easy to undo, even if it's been under heavy load. [link] Once you've mastered these, you should start understanding the dynamics of how knots can make ropes do all sorts of cool things.

You put a daub of this directly on the blistered area. Polysporin or that type of thing does not last as well as this stuff. Lambs wool : Take a bit of this and cover over the lanolin. Regular cotton balls do not cut it. Athletic Tape : Use large strips of tape to cover over the blistered area and enough on each side to keep the tape attached. Make quite a few layers. You'll know it's enough when you put your boot back on and walking no longer hurts. You can do this and leave it on until the end of your trip. Ideally, you don't want to get the setup wet for the first day. If it's pouring out, cover the whole mess with one layer of duct tape. I'm honestly not sure why it works, but I have fixed some horribly nasty blisters with this method and walked for 100s of kilometers afterwards. One particular happened on the Pacific Crest Trail, walking across a desert section, I wore a large circular area off my heel. When I eventually limped to a halt in the first bit of shade I found, this stuff together got me moving again with zero pain.

       "   'body': \"After a bit of digging I found this , which covers some in Europe (not extensively as I first thought!) It's worth pointing out that while for some (and probably most people here) wild camping means free-camping wandering around with a tent and supplies on foot, for many others it can mean driving around and parking up somewhere in a motor home. I refer to the first variety here, and this is the sort that is much less likely to give you problems (especially in countries where it's borderline.) In any country, but especially those where it's more of a grey area, if you know where you're going beforehand then a quick call to the landowner (if any) to check that it's ok won't do you any harm. While it may not always be necessary, it may help to put your mind at rest so you're not worried about being approached or asked to leave during your stay. Anyway, a general summary of countries in that link and elsewhere: France (See above link) A legal grey area, but is generally tolerated with the permission of landowners, or if you're well away from tourist sites. Don't light any fires. England and Wales (See above link) Generally not allowed without prior permission, though there are some exceptions (Dartmoor being the biggest one.) Scotland (See above link) Legal pretty much anywhere. Ireland It's tolerated in the more rural places, though it may be wise to obtain permission beforehand if you can. Spain and Portugal I believe it's tolerated but only in certain locations. Best to check with the landowner first to be sure. Germany Most of the links I can find suggest that it's not strictly speaking legal, but that many people have done it without any issues (providing you follow sensible precautions of course.) Netherlands Generally not allowed. There are a few spots where it is allowed, near a designated pole for so called 'pole camping' ( paalkamperen ) Italy (See above link) It doesn't seem to be tolerated, in fact most sources I can find seem to say it's explicitly banned in many places . Having said that, the same link also says there's lots of good campsites in a lot of nice locations around, so that may be your alternative. (Edit: This may be a little harsher than reality, see Tullochgorum's comment below.) Greece (See above link) Illegal, but the rule is apparently rampantly ignored, with many unpoliced areas. The risk is on you if you try it here. Norway Legal pretty much anywhere. Right to Roam . Sweden Legal pretty much anywhere. Outdoor Access Rights . Finland Legal pretty much anywhere. Everyman’s rights and the code of conduct on private land . Bulgaria (See above link) An interesting one - I can't find any sources saying whether it's legal or not, but in the summer apparently hundreds of hippy families relocate to the beaches, wild camp there and often strip nude for good measure. Estonia (See above link) A legal grey area, widely tolerated but best to obtain permission from the land owner beforehand. Albania Legal here on public land, but sometimes restricted for environmental reasons. Check first. Austria Can't find any authoritative sources. General consensus is that it seems to be discouraged, but as long as you're sensible then there shouldn't be an issue. Faroe Islands Not permitted . Camping is only permitted at designated campsites.\",\n",

If the embers are still warm, there's always the chance they'll spark up again in a strong wind with the right fuel. Embers can take hours to cool off, but if you put your fire out before you go to bed, they should be cool in the morning. Pouring cold water on them is another way to cool them quickly if you have to leave in a hurry. Remove sources of oxygen. Oxygen is the fuel for wood fires. You don't want a wind whipping through and heating up any old embers. Try to cover your fire pit with sand or dirt so that no embers are exposed. Remove all potential fuel. Scatter any remaining firewood so that it's at least a few feet from where the fire was. To the extent that it's possible, you should also try to remove any dry grass or small sticks. Pouring water on the pit also ensures that there isn't anything that'll spark up after you leave.\",\n",
